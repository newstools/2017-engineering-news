State-owned freight logistics group Transnet has described as &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; and &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo; reports that it has embarked on a retrenchment process. Some media reports have suggested that the utility may retrench up to 8 000 workers. However, in a statement Transnet said it was not contemplating any forced retrenchments. &ldquo;Any statement about retrenchments at Transnet is ill-advised, devoid of truth and may sew uncertainty among our employees.&rdquo; Transnet reaffirmed that it was offering a voluntary severance package (VSP) to employees, but stressed the VSP was &ldquo;completely voluntary&rdquo;. Transnet attributed the retrenchment reports to a statement issued by the United National Transport Union, which arose from a draft document that was superseded by the VSP process. &ldquo;At no stage did Transnet set any targets for the VSP process,&rdquo; the company added. Transnet also stressed that it was in a strong financial position and that it was continuing to pursue its capital investments, despite the challenging economic environment. In the 2016/17 financial year, Transnet increased revenues by 5.3% to R65.5-billion and reported a recovery in profits to R2.8-billion, from R393-million in 2016.
