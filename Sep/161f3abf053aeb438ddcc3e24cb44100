	State-owned Transnet on Thursday said Business Leadership South Africa’s (BLSA’s) statement claiming that it had suspended Transnet’s membership is inaccurate and misleading.
	  
	Transnet explained that BLSA had approached it earlier this year to consider renewing its membership for this year but that Transnet had elected not to renew its membership owing to cost-cutting measures. 
	“This was communicated to BLSA on August 9,” Transnet said in a statement.
	 
	The company subsequently received a meeting request from BLSA CEO Bonang Mohale to discuss the cancellation. 
	Transnet noted that the meeting has not taken place owing to diary clashes.
	 
	“While Transnet appreciates the role played by BLSA in South Africa, it is unfortunate that Mohale opted to mislead the public in such a spectacular manner.”
	 
	Transnet noted that it is aware of reports casting doubt on the integrity of its procurement processes and views these in a serious light and is currently conducting its own investigation on all allegations made.  
	“Should any actionable facts arise, necessary steps will be taken.”
