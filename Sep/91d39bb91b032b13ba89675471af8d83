Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) achieved a profit of R2-billion for the 2016/17 financial year, it was announced on Monday, up from R1.9-billion for the financial year 2015/16. &ldquo;This is probably the best set of results we&rsquo;ve presented in the history of the company,&rdquo; affirmed CEO Bongani Maseko in the results presentation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a stellar performance, with very good financial results,&rdquo; agreed acting CFO Dirk Kunz. It was the most profitable year the company has ever had. While domestic departing passenger volumes rose by only 2.1%, and unscheduled flight departing passenger volumes fell by 11.9%, regional departing passenger volumes increased by 4.5% and international ones by 5.8%. In terms of aircraft landing volumes, domestic and regional flights saw no change, unscheduled flight landings decreased by 3.3%, but landings by international aircraft rose by 2.7%. Kunz credited international flights as being the key to the company&rsquo;s growth during 2016/17. &ldquo;Airports like Cape Town and King Shaka [Durban] reported very strong growth,&rdquo; stated Maseko.&nbsp; Overall, the company showed itself to be resilient, despite the sluggish national economy, and maintained a strong financial profile, despite the country&rsquo;s credit ratings downgrade (as a predominantly State-owned company, Acsa&rsquo;s credit ratings are coupled with those of the country). Revenues came to R8.6-billion (up from R8.3-billion in 2015/16); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) were R5.1-billion (down from R5.2-billion in the previous financial year); but the ratio of net debt to Ebitda was 1.19, down from 1.48 in 2015/16. Return on investment was 11.3%, a decline from the 11.5% during the previous year. The company also received an unqualified audit opinion from the Auditor General and fulfilled 76% of its pre-planned targets. It developed a transformation strategy that embraces seven business sectors, namely advertising, baggage handling, car rental, construction, information technology, property and retail. &ldquo;We were able to exceed our target, with regard to preferential procurement,&rdquo; reported Maseko. The value of preferential procurement came to R2.8-billion during the financial year.
