South Africa&#39;s economy emerged from a technical recession in the second quarter as it expanded 2.5% after contracting by a revised 0.6% in the first quarter, Statistics South Africa said on Tuesday. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy entered recession in March after two consecutive quarters of contraction, but growth in agriculture in the three-months to end June supported a recovery. Gross domestic product rose 1.1% on an unadjusted year-on-year basis in the second quarter, compared with 1% expansion in the previous three months, the agency said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion of 2.1% and a year-on-year expansion of 0.4%.
