Data released by the Department of Trade and Industry on Monday shows that South African new-vehicle sales declined for the third year in a row in 2016. Sales dropped by 11.4%, to 547 442 units, compared with 617 648 units in 2015. New-vehicle sales fell 4.1% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2014. Looking at the various segments, 2016 new-passenger-car sales plummeted by 12.4%, sales of light commercial vehicles dropped by 8.9%, medium trucks by 18.7% and heavy trucks and buses by 7.4%. Commenting on the statistics, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) said in a statement that sales figures were pushed into the red by above-average new-vehicle price jumps, increases in interest rates, pressure on disposable income and low consumer confidence. &ldquo;[Last year] turned out to be another extremely difficult year for the South African automotive industry with domestic new-vehicle sales progressively under pressure, particularly at dealer level, despite attractive sales incentives and a strong contribution by the car rental sector, which accounted for an estimated 16.3% of new car sales during the year,&rdquo; noted Naamsa. The association said a preliminary estimate of 2016 motor-industry new-vehicle-related sales turnover indicated a decline of about 2% compared with 2015 &ndash; taking into account factors such as sales volumes and an estimated increase of about 14% in new-vehicle prices &ndash; to reach about R233-billion for the year. New-vehicle export sales are estimated to have added a further R105-billion to total industry revenue in 2016. The good news amid the gloom surrounding the domestic market is that new-vehicle exports from South Africa last year set an all-time record. Total vehicle exports reached 344 822 units, up from the 333 847 vehicles exported in 2015. Outlook for 2017 Naamsa believed a further improvement in the global economy&nbsp; &ndash; despite the &ldquo;volatile and uncertain conditions&rdquo; that were likely to prevail during 2017 &ndash; could lead to a 30 000-unit growth in new-vehicle exports from South Africa this year. The domestic market is unlikely to see the same growth. Naamsa said 2017 was expected to &ldquo;be another difficult year&rdquo; for the domestic auto industry, with only a modest improvement anticipated in new-vehicle sales, nudged along by a slightly improving South African economy. &ldquo;However, elevated political tensions are likely to continue to weigh on business confidence and the expected increase in taxes in this year&rsquo;s budget will erode real purchasing power.&rdquo; Naamsa said new-vehicle sales could reach around 561 000 units in 2017 &ndash; a 2.5% improvement over 2016 &ndash; with growth forecast in all vehicle segments. Taking into account the expected improvement in exports, Naamsa anticipated the production of vehicles in South Africa to increase by 6%, from 604 000 vehicles in 2016, to around 641 000 vehicles in 2017. &nbsp;
