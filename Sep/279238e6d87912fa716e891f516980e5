South Africa is in danger of missing its 2017 growth target of 1.3% due to poor performance of major sectors of the economy that will likely restrain tax revenues, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Monday. &quot;Our current level of growth is simply insufficient and not enough ... we cannot be complacent about the 2.5% second quarter growth that got us out of technical recession,&quot; Gigaba said in a speech at a tax conference. South Africa aims to collect R1.3-trillion ($98-billion) in taxes during the 2017/18 fiscal year that ends in March, versus the R1.14-trillion collected a year earlier. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy emerged from a recession after a 2.5% expansion in the three months to the end of June. The economy had contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter and by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2016.
