	The National Society of Black Engineers of South Africa (NSBE-SA) will hold its annual general meeting (AGM), conference and gala dinner on October 20. 
	The theme of this year’s conference is ‘20 Years of Transforming the Engineering Profession and Making the National Development Plan (NDP) a Reality for South Africans’. 
	The conference comes ahead of the countdown to 2018, where the organisation will mark 20 years since its formation.   
	“The purpose of the upcoming conference is to review the progress made so far by the organisation, for example: it will look at the number of engineering graduates produced, the black entrepreneurs in engineering, practicing professional engineers and engineering executives, as well as the black academics in engineering,” says NSBE-SA President Caesar Mtetwa.   
	The AGM and conference will be a platform for an educational dialogue among all industry players. It will also collect and disseminate information which contributes to the enhancement and development of the engineering industry. 
	The NSBE-SA will also use this conference to reflect on the impact this society has for black engineers and also to look ahead at the much-needed work of promoting and advocating for black engineers in the country and on the continent. 
	The AGM, conference and gala dinner will be held at CedarWoods of Sandton, in Woodmead, north of Johannesburg.
