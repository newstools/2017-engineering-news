The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to pay out a $320-million second tranche of Tunisia&#39;s loan programme after talks to agree on the government&#39;s reform priorities, the IMF Tunisia mission chief said on Monday. The portion of the $2.8-billion loan programme was delayed from December because of a lack of progress in reforms to cut public spending and overhaul state finances demanded by Tunisia&#39;s multilateral lenders.
