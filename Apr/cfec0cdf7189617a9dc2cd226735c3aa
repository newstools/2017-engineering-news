South Africa&#39;s new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Wednesday treasury is committed to fiscal consolidation plans outlined in the 2017 Budget after Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s (S&amp;P&#39;s) and Fitch downgraded the country to sub-investment grade. Speaking to local investors at the Development Bank of Southern Africa, Gigaba said the Treasury aims to stabilise the government&#39;s net debt over the next three years at 50% of gross domestic production. Last week Fitch downgraded South Africa&#39;s foreign and local currency debt to speculative grade, while S&amp;P&#39;s Global Ratings cut the hard currency borrowing to &quot;junk&quot;. Both cited likely changes in economic policy after a cabinet reshuffle.
