Pressure mounted on President Jacob Zuma to resign on Monday night as political parties laid South Africa&rsquo;s downgrade to junk status by Standard and Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P) squarely at his feet. The country&rsquo;s biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), described the downgrade as a vote of no confidence in Zuma. In a statement, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it was a direct result of Zuma firing respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle last week. &ldquo;President Zuma should resign immediately to allow a new administration to stabilise our economy, and to stanch this growing crisis,&rdquo; said Maimane. &ldquo;Standard &amp; Poors&rsquo; decision comes just days after President Zuma reshuffled his cabinet &ndash; sending shudders of uncertainty and volatility through our economy. International ratings agencies have long warned this government that our status is on a knife edge. Zuma has clearly learnt nothing from the market reaction to his firing of then Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015.&rdquo; At the same time, National Treasury, under the leadership of Gordhan&rsquo;s successor, Malusi Gigaba, went on the defence. &ldquo;While the leadership of the finance portfolio has changed, government&rsquo;s overall policy orientation remains the same. As indicated by Minister Gigaba on 1 April 2017, &lsquo;government has been, and will remain, committed to a measured fiscal consolidation that stabilises the rise in public debt&rsquo;,&rdquo; a statement from Treasury said. &ldquo;Reducing reliance on foreign savings to fund investment and relying less on debt to finance public expenditure will secure South Africa&rsquo;s fiscal sovereignty and economic independence.&rdquo; The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) echoed the DA&rsquo;s sentiments, calling for Zuma&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Mr Zuma has actively pursued a downgrade against all sound advice and warnings; and last week with his rogue cabinet reshuffle he put in the final nail into our economic coffin. On the back of this downgrade by Standard and Poor&rsquo;s, Mr Zuma must resign,&rdquo; said IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa. &ldquo;The so-called reshuffle was nothing but a pure political purge with its sight set on capturing National Treasury to loot the public purse; and the consequences for South Africa is a hard hitting downgrade to junk status.&rdquo; The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) said the downgrade was proof that Zuma continued to put his own private interests above those of the country. &ldquo;It will be the consumers who will pay the price for this because there is a risk that interest rates could rise significantly in the future, the economic growth rate will be more limited and taxpayers will have to pay for increased interest on government debt,&rdquo; said FF+ leader Pieter Groenewald. &ldquo;The financial suffering of the people of South Africa will only get worse as the financial pressure on the country mounts, and it&rsquo;s all caused by pres. Jacob Zuma.&rdquo;
