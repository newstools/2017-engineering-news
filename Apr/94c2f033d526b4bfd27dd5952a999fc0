Africa&rsquo;s first Radisson RED hotel is set to open in the third quarter of 2017 at the V&amp;A Waterfront&rsquo;s newly revamped Silo District, in Cape Town. The hotel chain, which successfully launched RED hotels in Brussels, Belgium, and Minneapolis, in the US, and with RED hotels in Campinas, Brazil, and Glasgow, Scotland, soon to follow, plans to settle its 252-room hotel in Silo Six at the waterfront, next to the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, which will open on September 27. &ldquo;Radisson RED is set to ignite the African hospitality experience. Forget stuffy hotels and rigid rules. Radisson RED is a revolution. From keyless entry to multifunctional social spaces, we have reinvented everything. We have made new rules,&rdquo; said Cape Town Radisson RED Hotel V&amp;A Waterfront curator Dale Simpson. The art, music and fashion-inspired hotel will boast a fully equipped gym and four events and games studios for up to 90 guests, as well as super-fast free Wi-Fi and 24/7 entertainment tech throughout the property. The animal-friendly hotel will also allow pets under 8 kg. The RED Roof will offer an &ldquo;early to late hangout&rdquo; space with a pool and views of Table Mountain, while food and drinks will be offered at the OUIBar and Ktchn. &ldquo;The response to the launch of these properties has been awesome and we have no doubt that Cape Town RED will be embraced by locals and unshackled global travellers alike,&rdquo; Simpson commented.
