The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has signed an agreement of cooperation and coordination with communications authority of Mozambique, Autoridade Reguladora Das Communica&ccedil;&otilde;es, in respect of spectrum management for telecommunications and broadcasting services. The agreement will see the establishment of a technical committee to deal with matters of common interest between the two regulators on radio frequency coordination. &ldquo;It is our commitment as regulators to make expertise, infrastructure and equipment available to assist each other on regulatory matters, including radio frequency spectrum investigations, possible cross-border spill-overs and of course, coordination of our services,&rdquo; Icasa acting chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga said in a statement. The technical agreement is a culmination of the memorandum of agreement entered into by the two governments in June 2015, aimed at finding new approaches and strategies for consolidating, expanding and deepening areas of economic development, industrial and trade cooperation between Mozambique and South Africa. &ldquo;This is a critical step for us as regulators because we have a common goal of ensuring that the needs of our people are considered and that their service consumption is exactly what they pay for,&rdquo; he noted.
