International engineering and project management consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV Group has launched a digital and interactive environmental-impact statement (EIS) to replace the traditional, outdated, paper-based reporting approach of interpreting data surrounding the environmental impact of a project. Three-dimensional visuals and videos now outline the environmental-impact assessment&rsquo;s (EIA&rsquo;s) findings and explain the &ldquo;nature of the issue and what the future situation will look like&rdquo;, making EIA reporting quicker, more interactive, transparent and accessible. &ldquo;The new EIS uses accessible, interactive visuals to revolutionise the way the results of an EIA are interpreted and shared between project partners, saving valuable time, accelerating decision-making and advancing stakeholder engagement,&rdquo; explains Royal HaskoningDHV South Africa MD Salani Sithole. The interactive Web-based platform was developed in response to an increasing demand for digitisation and transparency, says Royal HaskoningDHV EIA strategic adviser and co-creator of the digital EIS Paul Eijssen. &ldquo;The traditional manner of reporting an EIA was outdated and I knew we needed to innovate and change to ensure that the EIS continued to have relevance and impact in our collective decision-making processes,&rdquo; he says. The new digital platform boasts clickable maps, graphs and simple to understand tables, and enables users to &ldquo;walk through&rdquo; the virtual landscape and &ldquo;experience&rdquo; and view a better visual impression of a completed project. &ldquo;This will accelerate decision-making, enhance transparency and create greater stakeholder engagement,&rdquo; Eijssen adds. The digital platform was developed in collaboration with the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, and has received positive advice from the Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment. A joint pilot using an existing project &ndash; to reinforce the Houtrib dike, in the Netherlands &ndash; saw the existing environmental report converted into a digital interactive form that disclosed the information through a website, using modern visualisation techniques.
