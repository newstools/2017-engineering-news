Johannesburg Metrobus announced on Tuesday that it has implemented improved operating times on the OR Tambo International Airport route during off-peak hours to connect commuters with airlines. &ldquo;Passengers travelling to and from OR Tambo International Airport will find the additional bus services to be highly efficient, and to provide a much-needed connection to the city centre of Johannesburg,&rdquo; said acting MD Sabata Makoele. Metrobus said that a bus route to OR Tambo International Airport would now offer seven daily trips to and from OR Tambo International Airport terminals to Gandhi Square in the Johannesburg central business district. Johannesburg Metro buses ferry about 55 000 commuters every weekday on over 220 routes within the City of Johannesburg. The buses would travel through Bertrams; Albertina Sisulu Road; Eastgate Terminus; Bedford Plaza; Barbara Road /R24; Kempton Park to support shift times for airport staff and commuters that are travelling from the City of Johannesburg to OR Tambo International Airport or vice versa. &ldquo;Johannesburg Metrobus is currently undergoing a transformation process including a new business model in order to ensure that the City of Johannesburg provides effective and efficient public transport system to its citizens,&rdquo; Makoele said. The OR Tambo International Airport Metrobus Service operates every two hours with stops at Kempton Park, Hillbrow and Gandhi Square. The buses are departing from the Gandhi Square Metrobus site with select trips to the OR Tambo Airport Post Office. Metrobus said that the trip to OR Tambo took about 40 to 55 minutes during morning peak traffic hours, and around 45 to 55 minutes during afternoon rush-hour traffic, while during other times of the day the journey only took about 30 to 45 minutes. Tickets for the OR Tambo International Airport routes can be purchased at Gandhi Square and cost between R10.20 and R21.76 per person for a one-way trip.
