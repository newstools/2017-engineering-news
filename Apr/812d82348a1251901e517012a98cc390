Public Enterprises&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;Lynne Brown&nbsp;has&nbsp;granted&nbsp;Eskom&rsquo;s board&nbsp;more&nbsp;time&nbsp;to&nbsp;resolve,&nbsp;through&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutually beneficial consultation process,&nbsp;issues around a&nbsp;pension payout&nbsp;to&nbsp;its&nbsp;former&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;Brian&nbsp;Molefe. &nbsp; Brown on&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;turned down&nbsp;the&nbsp;board&rsquo;s&nbsp;proposal to award Molefe a R30-million pension payout. &nbsp; The board was given seven days to forward an appropriate pension proposal to Brown. Chairperson Dr Ben Ngubane approached me this week and indicated that the process has started, however, he requested an extension, which I have granted,&quot; she said. &nbsp;
