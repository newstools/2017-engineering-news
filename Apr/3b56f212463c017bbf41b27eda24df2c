Thyssenkrupp could cut about 4 000 of the 27 000 jobs at its European steel unit in a coming restructuring of the business, a representative of trade union IG Metall told Reuters on Tuesday. The German industrial group had said on Friday it planned to cut costs by 500-million euros ($530-million) at its steel unit, which it is seeking to merge with Tata Steel&#39;s European operations to curb overcapacity. A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp reiterated on Tuesday it was not yet decided how many jobs would be cut.
