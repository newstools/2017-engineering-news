The 300 MW expansion of two units at Botswana&#39;s Morupule B coal-fired power plant has been delayed due to a dispute with the contractor over an $800-million guarantee, a cabinet minister said on Wednesday. Japan&#39;s Marubeni and South Korea&#39;s Posco Energy were last year awarded the contract for the expansion, but a row between them and the government over a sovereign guarantee has delayed the plant&#39;s expansion. The minister of energy Security and Green Technology, Sadique Kebonang, said the builders were due to start work in January but demanded the payment of a $800-million guarantee in case the loss-making Botswana Power Corporation failed to pay. Kebonang said only Parliament, which is on a recess until July, can approve such a payment. Officials at Japan&#39;s Marubeni and South Korea&#39;s Posco Energy were not available to comment. The plant would eventually generate a total of 1 200 MW when all the expansions are completed by May 2020. The government hopes to export power to other countries in the region after the expansion is completed. The coal-fired power station was originally built by the China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) at a cost of $970-million but has often broken down, leading to a reliance on diesel generators and imports from South Africa.
