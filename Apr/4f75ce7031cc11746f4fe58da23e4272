Mexican breadmaker Grupo Bimbo said on Thursday it has entered the African market with the purchase of Adghal, a Morocco-based producer of baked goods. Financial details were not provided. Adghal reported sales of some $11-million, three plants and specialized in pastries and cupcakes, Bimbo said in a statement. Bimbo is one of the world&#39;s biggest breadmakers, with operations in the United States, Canada, Latin America and China as well as the Iberian peninsula and Britain. Bimbo&#39;s food business chief said last week it planned to grow in China through acquisitions, expand in the rest of Asia, and enter Middle Eastern markets.
