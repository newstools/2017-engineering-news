The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has appointed the Port of Cape Town&rsquo;s first female port manager Mpumi Dweba, who most recently served as port manager at the Port of Ngqura. She succeeds Sipho Nzuza, who recently resigned to take up the role of eThekwini municipality city manager. TNPA has also appointed Captain Vernal Jones as the Saldanha port manager, succeeding Willem Roux, who resigned earlier this year. TNPA noted that the appointments would assist in sharpening its focus on the delivery of its strategic objectives and improve operational efficiencies. Meanwhile, former Mossel Bay port manager Tandi Lebakeng has been transferred to the Port of Ngqura to succeed Dweba. Lebakeng has been with Transnet for more than 20 years and her experience spans trade and logistics, business strategy and planning and development. While these changes temporarily leave the ports of East London and Mossel Bay with vacant port manager positions, the roles will be fulfilled in an acting capacity by port engineer, Alvin Singama, in East London, and senior operations manager, Shadrack Tshikalange, in Mossel Bay. The company also appointed Jacqueline Brown, the former East London port manager, as executive manager for capacity development and enablement.
