The global steel market will tighten in coming years and eventually go into a&nbsp;deficit in 2020, says research firm BMI.&nbsp; Despite the slowing in both global production and consumption growth, larger increases in absolute consumption, compared with production, will lead to a tightening of the market. The global steel market will see the surplus shrink to 7.6-million tons in 2017 from a surplus of 10.5-million tons in 2016, owing to a larger increase in absolute consumption compared with production. The market will reach a de cit of 4.2-million tons in 2021 as production growth fails to keep up with&nbsp; consumption growth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Global steel production growth will remain muted as steel producers face di culty in maintaining&nbsp; pro tability in the continued subdued price environment. While output in the Chinese steel sector will be supported by resilient steel prices this year, production thereafter will decline owing to a relapse in steel prices and government&#39;s desire to curb overcapacity in the domestic industry and consolidate the sector. China will remain the driving force behind global steel production. BMI estimates the country will account for 50.5% of global steel production this year, but that its share of global steel production will decrease to 47.8% by 2021.
