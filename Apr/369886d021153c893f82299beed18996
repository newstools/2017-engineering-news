Several executive positions in the country&rsquo;s State-owned energy entities have remained vacant for a year or more, a written Parliamentary reply by Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi reveals. The Petroleum Agency of South Africa (PASA) has now been without a CEO for five years. Kubayi explained that the position had remained vacant since the term of office of the previous CEO ended. &ldquo;The position for CEO was advertised but no interviews were held, pending the finalisation to move PASA from the Department of Energy to the Department of Mineral Resources as envisaged in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act Amendment Bill,&rdquo; she said. The Central Energy Fund (CEF) has not had a permanent CEO for the past two years, with Mojalefa Moagi currently acting CEO. Interviews were held on March 27 and 28, and the vacancy is expected to be filled by June 1, Kubayi noted. The position of CEF CFO had also been vacant for four months, with the previous incumbent having resigned in November 2016. Lufuno Makhuba was permanently appointed to the position on April 1. Meanwhile, embattled national oil company PetroSA, which is set to suffer a projected devaluation of assets of R1.1-billion this financial year, in addition to the R14.5-billion impairment it suffered in the 2014/15 financial year, has not had a CEO for one year and four months. Kubayi said the company was in the process of headhunting for a new CEO, with an appointment set to be made by month-end. Also without a CEO for the past year and ten months, the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) started its recruitment process in February last year. However, Kubayi said this process was placed on hold, pending the CEF group business model review. Acting CEF CEO Moagi was also managing the SFF role in the interim.
