JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The attributable production of ferrochrome company, Merafe Resources, increased by 10% in the first quarter of this year. Attributable production was 113 000 t, up from last year&rsquo;s first quarter output of 103 000 t. The increase in the attributable ferrochrome output from the Glencore-Merafe Chrome Venture is primarily due to improved performances and efficiencies across the venture&rsquo;s furnaces, coupled to the restarting of Rustenburg furnace 5 in the second half of 2016, the JSE-listed Merafe said on Tuesday. The first quarter European benchmark ferrochrome price of $165/lb, applicable for the three months to March 31, was 6.7% higher than the current second quarter price of $1.54/lb, which is applicable in the three months to June 30. Merafe, headed by CEO Zanele Matlala, shares in 20.5% of the earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of the Glencore-Merafe Chrome Venture, the largest ferrochrome producer in the world with combined installed capacity of 2.34-million tonnes of ferrochrome a year. The venture operates eight chromite mines and 22 ferrochrome furnaces. &nbsp; The demand for ferrochrome is driven overwhelmingly by the production of stainless steel, which is projected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 and by 3.8% in 2018. In the 12 months to December 31, Merafe&rsquo;s share of the venture&rsquo;s Ebitda was R1 176.2-million, 38% higher than in 2015.
