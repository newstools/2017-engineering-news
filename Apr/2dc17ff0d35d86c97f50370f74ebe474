JSE-listed Hulisani has entered into a R26.5-million share sale agreement with Pravin Semnarayan and Gareth Warner to acquire 100% of the issued ordinary shares in holding company Momentous Technologies. Momentous is currently a 15% shareholder of Rustmo1 Solar Farm &ndash; a 7 MW solar photovoltaic plant in Buffelspoort in the North West. Rustmo1, operated by Juwi Renewable Energies was the first independent power producer to be connected to the grid under government&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme and has been operating since November 2013. In February, Momentous triggered its preemptive right to acquire an additional 51% of the issued share capital of Rustmo1 from existing Rustmo1 shareholders for R88.5-milllion, plus interest. Hulisani will fund the transaction from cash reserves.
