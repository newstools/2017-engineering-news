Eskom, which has excess capacity of about 4 000 MW, on Wednesday said it has signed a three-year &ldquo;firm power supply agreement&rdquo; with Botswana Power Corporation (BPC). The power utility said the move was is in line with its plan to increase electricity exports to neighbouring states. Last Friday, Eskom&rsquo;s Interim Group CE Matshela Koko met his BPC counterpart, Dr Stefan Schwarzfischer, to conclude the power supply agreement and to discuss other areas of potential cooperation. &ldquo;The conclusion of this agreement serves to demonstrate our commitment to the SADC region to provide energy security and certainty with regard to long-term supply of energy,&rdquo; Koko said. &ldquo;Eskom reaffirms its position that we are &lsquo;open for business&rsquo; and stand ready to undertake further long-term supply agreements, for up to ten years, with our various trading partners.&rdquo; Dr Schwarzfischer said: &ldquo;This new firm power agreement offers BPC improved security of supply and presents us with a window of opportunity to tackle some of the major challenges facing our generation plant. We look forward to further collaboration with Eskom to further improve our energy and various technical aspects of the electricity business.&rdquo; The agreement was the second one that Eskom has signed in just over a week, having recently concluded a five-year power sales agreement with the Namibian national power utility, NamPower. Eskom and BPC have had a long-standing energy trading relationship.
