Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday rejected the &ldquo;spread of falsehood and misinformation&rdquo; that he has resigned from his official position as deputy president of South Africa. &ldquo;There is no truth to the dissemination of this falsehood,&rdquo; his spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa said. Ramaphosa remained in his position as deputy president of the country and that of the African National Congress. &ldquo;We reiterate his view that he will remain in government to serve the people in the realisation of the national objective of pushing back the frontiers of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. &ldquo;In this regard Deputy President Ramaphosa on Friday 31 March 2017 in Bloemfontein said: &lsquo;&hellip; I am staying to serve our people in government. I made my views known. There are quite a number of other colleagues and comrades who are unhappy about this situation, particularly the removal of the minister of finance who was serving the country with absolute distinction, with great ability, and he has proven that he is a talented person&hellip;&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mamoepa said.
