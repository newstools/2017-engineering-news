The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Monday welcomed Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown&rsquo;s decision to decline State-owned electricity provider Eskom&rsquo;s proposal to pay its former CEO Brian Molefe a R30-million pension payout, noting that it was setting a precedent by placing an end to the &ldquo;incessant and unnecessary golden handshakes&rdquo; paid to officials. Brown said she could not support the board&rsquo;s reasons for the payout. &quot;I found the argument presented by the board on why the pension arrangement was conceived lacking in legal rationale and it cannot be substantiated as a performance reward, as Molefe has already been granted a performance bonus for his contribution to the turnaround of Eskom,&rdquo; she said. Further, Brown noted that the proposed pension payout was not justifiable in light of the current financial challenges faced not only by State-owned companies (SOCs) but by the country as a whole. Outa chairperson Wayne Duvenage said golden handshakes have frustrated the public for far too long and called on Brown to &ldquo;scrutinise and question&rdquo; the Eskom board&#39;s request for the pension payout and to &ldquo;hold them accountable for their unacceptable conduct&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is clear to Outa that the Molefe payout scandal, along with many other actions resulting in wasteful expenditure and gross maladministration, points to poor leadership, highly questionable conduct and a board that needs to be replaced,&rdquo; he noted. Brown further instructed the Eskom board to &ldquo;urgently&rdquo; engage with Molefe and report back on a new pension proposal within a week.
