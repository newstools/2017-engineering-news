The South African truck market demonstrated ongoing resilience in the first quarter of 2017, despite political and economic turmoil, says UD Trucks Southern Africa MD Gert Swanepoel. However, South Africa&rsquo; s recent downgrade by two ratings agencies will determine if the marginal growth achieved by the industry to date will hold up, or be eroded. &ldquo;The next few months will be critical in determining the path we as a country will follow. Leadership in all spheres of business, but mostly in government will be key,&rdquo; says Swanepoel. &ldquo;The adage &lsquo;cometh the hour, cometh the man (or woman)&rsquo; will now be more relevant than ever. According to the latest sales results released by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa and Imperial&rsquo;s Motus Corporation, the country&rsquo;s total new-truck market increased 16.9% in March, compared with the same month last year, to 2&nbsp;618 units.&nbsp; This brought the South African total new-truck market to 6&nbsp;416 units for the first quarter of 2017, a 3.9% increase over the same period last year. During the first three months of the year, sales in the medium commercial vehicle segment expanded by 3.3%, to 1&nbsp;993 units, compared with the first quarter of 2016.&nbsp; Sales in the heavy commercial vehicle segment increased by 11.9%, to 1&nbsp;355 units, while the extra-heavy commercial segment grew by 2.2%, to 2&nbsp;837 units. The only segment that failed to achieve growth for the first three months of the year was the bus market, registering a 10.5% decline, to a total of 231 new units. &ldquo;Even amidst all the turbulence, we believe the dust will settle and the steady slog towards growth in the truck industry will begin once more,&rdquo; notes Swanepoel.&nbsp; &ldquo;We still expect the South African commercial vehicle market to grow by an estimated 3% during 2017, to around 28 998 units.&rdquo;
