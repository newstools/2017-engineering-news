A R2.4-billion programme for electricity in informal settlements across Ekurhuleni will be completed by the end of this financial year covering 16 000 households, Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mzwandile Masina announced. The legalities on the roll-out of the programme in privately owned informal settlements are still being reviewed while the five-year programme has already started in informal settlements located on State-owned land. Masina said: &ldquo;We have begun to electrify households in our current informal settlements as per our manifesto commitment. We are also planning to install street lights to improve the safety of our people, especially women and children.&rdquo; A total of 9 943 households in informal settlements like Langaville, Inxiweni, Marikana, Winnie Mandela and Ekurhuleni, to date, has already been electrified. Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality spokesperson, Themba Gadebe, said: &ldquo;The installation of streetlights is currently being rolled out with 2 263 streets lights of the targeted 3 000 and 156 high mast lights already installed while working tirelessly to achieve the targeted 400 high mast lights around Ekurhuleni&rsquo;s 119 informal settlements.&rdquo; The improvement for lighting in households for the poor stability in energy sources and this programme is under way to ensure the necessary safe and secure electricity connections. &ldquo;These plans include the implementation of alternative and renewable energy to limit dependence on the national grid and improve the security of energy while protecting the environment by limiting greenhouse emissions,&rdquo; Gadebe added.
