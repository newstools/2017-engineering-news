S&amp;P Global Ratings lowered South Africa&#39;s sovereign credit rating on Monday to a subinvestment grade of BB+, from BBB-, on political and institutional uncertainty. It has also sustained its &ldquo;negative outlook&rdquo; on the country. The downgrade was in direct response President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet shuffle, which took place at midnight on March 31. The ratings agency said the executive changes &ldquo;have put at risk fiscal and growth outcomes&rdquo;. &quot;The downgrade reflects our view that the divisions in the ANC-led government that have led to changes in the executive leadership, including the Finance Minister, have put policy continuity at risk,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement. During the shuffle, Zuma replaced the highly respected Pravin Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba, who was previously Home Affairs Minister. The negative outlook, meanwhile, reflected a view that political risks would remain elevated in 2017 and that policy shifts were likely. The agency saw higher risks of Budgetary slippage, and upward pressure on South Africa&#39;s cost of capital, which would further dampen already-modest growth. Also reassessed was South Africa&#39;s contingent liabilities, reflecting an increased risk that nonfinancial public enterprises, such as Eskom, would need further &ldquo;extraordinary government support&rdquo;. S&amp;P Global Ratings lowered the long-term South Africa national scale rating to &#39;zaAA-&#39; from &#39;zaAAA&#39;.
