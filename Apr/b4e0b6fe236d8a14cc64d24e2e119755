Property investment and development business Atterbury has been awarded the tender to develop a new office for Deloitte in Waterfall City, in Midrand, Gauteng, as the audit firm consolidates its Johannesburg and Pretoria offices. The total estimated R1-billion-plus development cost is expected to produce an ultramodern 42 500 m2 property able to house over 5 000 people when completed in the first quarter of 2020. &ldquo;We are quickly outgrowing both existing office spaces and are now in a position to bring together approximately 3 700 of our people into one, new, custom-designed building in what is clearly an attractive corporate destination,&rdquo; said Deloitte Africa COO Mike Jarvis. The new premises will boast six storeys of offices and four basement parking levels catering for 2 000 parking bays. &ldquo;Innovative commercial architecture practice Aevitas designed the new Deloitte headquarters, which will comply with a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Rating on completion,&rdquo; he added. Bulk earthworks for the project will start in August, with construction starting in the final quarter of this year. Deloitte will begin operating from its new base from April 2020.
