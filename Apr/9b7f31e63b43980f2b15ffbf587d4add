From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Lifting solutions company SA French recently showcased its permanent and temporary lifting gear in an effort to show customers its potential in various sectors. Dylan Slater tells us more. Dylan Slater: SA French is the South African distributor of Potain cranes and lifting solutions. One of these unique pieces of equipment is the Potain IGO self-erecting crane, which can be remotely-operated by a single person from ground-level. SA French managing director Quentin van Breda explains the evolution of the concept of a self-erecting crane over the years and what the new model offers. SA French MD Quentin van Breda: &nbsp; Dylan Slater: The fundamental concept of a self-erecting crane lies in its ability to be easily transportable via road to any destination. In this regard, the Potain IGO self-erecting cranes have been designed specifically to perform this task with ease and can be trailered to almost any site with decent road access. SA French MD Quentin van Breda &nbsp; Dylan Slater: These cranes are relatively small and nimble, and therefore boast significant benefits in terms of being able to move around a site very easily as opposed to larger, fixed tower cranes which can take several days to dismantle, and even longer to re-assemble Dylan Slater: SA French also offers hoists which can be used to transport personnel and light equipment vertically.
