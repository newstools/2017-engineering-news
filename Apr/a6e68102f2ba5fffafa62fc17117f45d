Heavy equipment manufacturer Bell Equipment has signed a black economic empowerment (BEE) agreement with SiBi Capital, an entity entirely owned and managed by black women. When concluded, SiBi Capital will hold 22.5% of Bell Equipment Sales South Africa (Bessa), the wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Equipment. Bessa provides sales and aftermarket support for Bell-designed and -manufactured products, as well as for strategic alliance partner products, in South Africa. A further 7.5% stake in Bessa will be held by the newly formed Bell Equipment Foundation, a broad-based trust with black women as its beneficiaries, while Bell Equipment retains 70% ownership in Bessa. SiBi Capital is represented by Bharti Harie and Sindi Mabaso-Koyana, who each own 50% of the entity. Bell CEO Gary Bell explained that the agreement was structured to pursue real transformation, while aligning the company&rsquo;s business strategy with government&#39;s economic transformation policies.&nbsp; He added that this would place Bell in a position to be the only yellow equipment company that produces locally, allowing its customers to claim the benefit of buying products from a 30% black women-owned entity. This could potentially earn them an additional four points in their overall broad-based black economic empowerment score, which, in turn, when verified, increases their ability to bid for and win contracts. &quot;It was necessary to create a sustainable funding structure that is not reliant on external finance. We believe this objective has been met and that we can create a long-term relationship with SiBi Capital, through Bharti and Sindi, who can add real value to the Bessa business,&quot; said Bell.
