In its efforts to accelerate economic growth and development in designated regions of the country, government is set to launch the Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone (MAP-SEZ) in Tshiame, near Harrismith, in the eastern Free State, on April 25. Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies said the launch of the 1 038 ha MAP-SEZ is another significant milestone in the implementation of the department&rsquo;s special economic zone programme. &ldquo;The Industrial Policy Action Plan identifies SEZs as key contributors to economic development. They are growth engines towards government&#39;s strategic objectives of industrialisation, regional development and employment creation. &ldquo;The SEZ programme has entered a full implementation phase.&nbsp; This is one of the critical instruments that the DTI is using to accelerate industrialisation in the country,&rdquo; said Davies. He added that the SEZ programme was a critical tool for the attraction of foreign direct investments (FDIs), creation of decent jobs, establishment of new industrial centres, as well as development and improvement of the existing infrastructure. &ldquo;The MAP-SEZ will create opportunities for manufacturing as well as a regional and international trade environment with added value chain within the Maluti-A-Phofung municipality. &ldquo;The social and economic benefits, as well as regional development, will be key and will be enhanced by creating a prosperous trade city and functional trade ecosystem, which will enable the beneficiation of mineral and natural resources and attract FDI. The priority sectors for the MAP-SEZ are automotive, agroprocessing, logistics, pharmaceuticals and general processing&rdquo;, said Free State Premier Elias Magashule.
