Inspiring Fifty South Africa has issued an open call for nominations for inspiring South African women working in the different spheres of the technology and innovation sectors. Inspiring Fifty is a Netherlands-based nonprofit organisation (NPO) that showcases the work of inspiring female role models in the technology industry in the Netherlands, France, Europe and Scandinavia. Each year, the NPO recognises 50 inspiring women in the technology sector, with the aim of providing a platform that improves visibility of the achievements of women in the innovation and technology sectors. &ldquo;The African tech ecosystem is growing exponentially. This is reshaping the South African economy as technology and innovation are leapfrogging beyond established technology, ideas and infrastructure,&rdquo; Netherlands Consul General Bonnie Horbach said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to be moving this initiative to the African continent as we share the same important goals around inclusive economic growth, diversity, innovation and entrepreneurship. We look forward to collaborating to co-create and shape ideas to bring about positive and lasting change to the sector across the globe,&rdquo; she added.
