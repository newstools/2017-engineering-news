The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says history will be made during a nationwide shutdown on Friday in protest against President Jacob Zuma and corruption. &quot;The conduct by the authorities in trying to place approval barriers in the way of the Pretoria march to the Union Buildings is a stark reminder of the behaviour that once emanated from an authoritarian government of yesteryear, one which feared the power of the people,&quot; chairperson Wayne Duvenage said. Duvenage said Friday will be a historical day that will trigger the formation of unity between civil society organisations, political parties, labour and faith-based organisations to grow into structured movements, in order to place pressure on a government that is found wanting in good governance and respect for the people. &quot;Today [Friday] marks the start of a rolling mass-action campaign against the governing authorities, who need to be reminded of their role [to] serve the best interests of the people.&quot; Duvenage has urged marchers to march peacefully. Despite some administrative confusion and Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane calling all marches in Pretoria illegal, the Save South Africa march to the Union Buildings has been granted permission to go ahead on Friday. The organisation filed an urgent application with the chief magistrate on Thursday evening. The Democratic Alliance will &quot;march for change&quot; in Johannesburg at 10:00 on Friday. The march will start at the Westgate transport hub and end at Mary Fitzgerald Square.
