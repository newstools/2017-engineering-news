Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P&rsquo;s) decision to downgrade South Africa&rsquo;s sovereign debt to junk status will have a significant impact on the country&rsquo;s agribusiness sector, with a knock-on effect on consumers, agricultural business chamber Agbiz said on Friday. CEO Dr John Purchase explained that the downgrade would impact food security, noting that the &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; political developments would, in time, manifest in higher food prices, and severely compromise the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;good food security status&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is especially the poorest of the consumers that will suffer the most,&rdquo; he said, adding that the timing of these developments was &ldquo;most unfortunate&rdquo;, as there were already clear signs of improved growth prospects in both the agrofood sector and the country&rsquo;s economy. He said agribusinesses would now have to carefully analyse the concomitant risks associated with such a downgrade and develop strategies to adapt to and survive in a business environment that is in all probability not going to be favourable.
