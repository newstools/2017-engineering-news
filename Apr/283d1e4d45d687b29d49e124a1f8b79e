The Pan-African infrastructure investment platform Africa50, which is funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB), has appointed Kenyan-born Carole Wamuyu Wainaina as CEO. She will lead a multidisciplinary team on the noninvestment side of the organisation, including investor relations, strategy, communications, human resources and administration, and environmental and social governance. &ldquo;Wainaina has substantial private sector experience and recognised global organisational leadership and team building skills. &ldquo;This will be critical as we continue to build Africa50 into a high-performing investment platform for infrastructure project development and investment in Africa, with a diverse group of investors - from African governments to the private sector,&rdquo; AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina said.
