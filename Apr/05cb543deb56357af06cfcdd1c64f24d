Two South African National Energy Association (Sanea) nominees, Avesh Padayachee and Pule Segale, have been selected to participate in the global World Energy Council (WEC) Future Energy Leaders 100 programme. The WEC admits 100 future energy leaders to a three-year part-time global programme of specific learning and mentorship designed to position participants for future global leadership positions.&nbsp; Each year 35 participants graduate, opening space for 35 new entrants. &ldquo;Our nominees have been selected for the 2017 intake and we are very proud of these young South Africans,&rdquo; Sanea secretary general Dave Wright said in a statement on Thursday. He stated that there were 160 nominees from all over the world vying for the 35 positions, making their achievement significant. &ldquo;They will not only benefit greatly from being part of this global programme but they will also ensure that the South African perspective is shared with the faculty and other participants,&rdquo; he said.
