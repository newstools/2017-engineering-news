Moody&#39;s said on Tuesday it will not issue a sovereign credit rating decision on South Africa this Friday, as previously planned, but will do so after a review that could take 30 to 90 days. Moody&#39;s announced on Monday that it had placed South Africa on a review for a downgrade after a Cabinet reshuffle that saw a respected former finance minister dismissed from his post. Moody&#39;s currently has South Africa&#39;s sovereign at two notches above non-investment grade at Baa2.
