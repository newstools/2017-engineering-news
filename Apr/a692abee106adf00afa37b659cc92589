Earthworks and services installation have started for the first phase of a new 450 000 m2 industrial precinct in Durbanville - the Atlantic Hills business park - with the first tenant expected to take occupation in January 2018, construction company Abland says. The first phase will involve the development of 60 000 m2 on the 72 ha site. Around 45 ha has been zoned for light industrial business, including distribution, warehousing and cold storage businesses. Abland notes that the Atlantic Hills business park is well positioned for future city growth, while offering tenants who would like to be closer to home or move their existing premises from the more traffic-congested areas &ldquo;perfect placement&rdquo;. Situated on the Potsdam interchange, with direct access onto the M12 and immediate access onto the N7 and M13, the Atlantic Hills business park provides easy access to the V&amp;A Harbour, Montague Gardens, Killarney Gardens, Atlantis, Durbanville, Parklands and Plattekloof. Atlantic Hills will also be integrated into the City of Cape Town&rsquo;s transport system, providing public transport access from Milnerton, Parklands, Plattekloof and Durbanville. The size of the stands is flexible and can be custom designed from 1 000 m&sup2; to 100 000 m&sup2;. A portion of the precinct will be developed for mixed use, offering tenants a retail component, including a petrol station with convenience shopping and fast food outlets. Two areas of the business park have been earmarked for conservation, primarily to protect a rare species of Renosterveld fynbos that only grows on granite found in this area. The reserve will be fully environmentally protected and offer tenants the pleasure of a green space near their place of work.
