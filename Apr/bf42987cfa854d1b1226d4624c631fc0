Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown expects the recruitment process for a new CEO at Eskom to be concluded by the end of May. Matshela Koko has been acting CEO since November 2016, when Brian Molefe resigned as CEO, following the release of a Public Protector report alleging his involvement with the controversial Gupta family. In a written reply to a Parliamentary question, published on Wednesday, the Minister revealed that Eskom had, on March 5, published an advert for the position. Meanwhile, Brown revealed that other SoEs falling under the Department of Public Enterprises umbrella had vacancies in executive positions. This included diamond miner Alexkor, with vacancies for CEO and CFO; Denel with vacancies for CEO and CFO; South African Express Airways currently only having an acting CEO, Victor Xaba, and the South African Forestry Company with vacancies for a CEO and a COO. Transnet was the only SoE that did not have any vacancies in senior executive positions, Brown noted.
