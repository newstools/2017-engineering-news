State-owned Eskom&nbsp;CFO Anoj Singh says the entity&rsquo;s funding requirements for the 2017/18 financial year will not be affected by Standard and Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P&rsquo;s) decision to downgrade its corporate credit rating, as 72% of the current fiscal year&rsquo;s funding of R72-billion will be secured by end-April. &ldquo;We are confident that we will successfully execute Eskom&rsquo;s funding plan over the next five years backed by the availability of the government guarantees; the only challenge that Eskom will have to contend with will be the higher cost of debt.&rdquo; S&amp;P&rsquo;s earlier this month lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Eskom to &lsquo;B+&rsquo; from &lsquo;BB-&rsquo;, following its ratings action to downgrade South Africa&rsquo;s long-term foreign currency rating credit rating to &lsquo;BB+&rsquo;. Moody&rsquo;s Investor Services also announced its decision to place Eskom&rsquo;s Ba1 senior unsecured medium term note rating on review for downgrade; the rating agency has simultaneously placed Eskom&rsquo;s global scale corporate family rating of Ba1 and its national scale rating of A2.za on review for downgrade. Moody&rsquo;s review decision on Eskom also follows the rating agency&rsquo;s decision to place the sovereign&rsquo;s Baa2 bond rating on review for downgrade, also on April 3.
