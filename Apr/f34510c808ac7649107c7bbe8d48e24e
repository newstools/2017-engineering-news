JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The coal wash plant for use at Edenville Energy&rsquo;s Rukwa coal mine has been delivered to port in the UK and inspected and cleared by the appropriate authorities, ready for shipment to Tanzania. The first of the shipments is expected to leave the UK this month and will take six weeks to arrive in Tanzania. &quot;I am very grateful for the hard work and professionalism from the team preparing the wash plant for shipment. They have been able to achieve this in approximately one month, meeting the target to move the containers to the port,&rdquo; CEO Rufus Short said. The cargo comprises 15 main containerised units which hold the associated pieces to complete the plant assembly.&nbsp; The plant was fully inspected by an independent wash plant consultant for suitability and condition prior to purchase. A new spares package has also been bought, which will ensure critical area components, such as pumps, are readily available should the need arise.
