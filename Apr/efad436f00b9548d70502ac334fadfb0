South Africa&#39;s new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Tuesday he would focus on accelerating reforms to corporate governance at the country&#39;s ailing State-owned companies following a downgrade to &quot;junk&quot; by S&amp;P. Gigaba said he had spoken to the other major rating firms Fitch and Moody&#39;s to reassure them about his plans to keep fiscal policy unchanged and deal with political instability.
