The administrator of South African domain zones .co.za and .web.za, ZA Central Registry (ZACR), on Monday invited applications from businesses, civil society and other interested parties for its dotAfrica (.africa) pioneer programme. This is in an effort to create brand awareness and visibility for the newly launched Geographic Top Level Domain (gTLD) to millions of African and global consumers. Successful applicants will, subject to the relevant terms and conditions, be given preferential access to an approved .africa domain name prior to the start of general availability &ndash; before the general public is allowed to register .africa domains from July 4. &ldquo;The programme represents a golden opportunity for interested parties to further cement their association or affiliation with the African continent. An approved .africa domain name will enable companies to showcase their brand and its commitment to the continent, while establishing a home for Africa-specific products and services,&quot; said ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela. In addition, the new dotAfrica gLTD will also enable the expansion of regional influence and the acquisition of valuable online real estate in a fast-growing and high-potential market. Applicants are required to highlight key innovative qualities of their organisations, emphasising their relevance to Africa and their ability to harness the .africa domain name to further amplify their current brand journey. The applications need to further outline plans to use the domain name to share Africa&rsquo;s message with the &#39;global village&#39;. Successful companies, nonprofit organisations, bloggers and governments that join the pioneer programme will be granted access to the dotAfrica domain of their choosing during the launch period. Applications close on May 15.
