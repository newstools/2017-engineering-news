Former Constitutional Court judge Justice Richard Goldstone has joined antidumping organisation FairPlay, which was formed to oppose the illegal and job-destroying practice of selling goods below the cost of production, as its patron. FairPlay&rsquo;s first project will be to focus on stopping the dumping of chicken in South Africa. Founder Francois Baird noted that the organisation was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; to have a person of the intellect and integrity of Justice Goldstone serve as the movement&rsquo;s patron. &ldquo;Dumping is a scourge which destroys industries in South Africa and elsewhere. Justice Goldstone is known around the world as a man who fights injustice and we look forward to his guidance as we fight dumping worldwide,&rdquo; Baird said. Goldstone emphasised that he was a firm supporter of fair trade and competition. &ldquo;When international trade is conducted according to the rules agreed multilaterally in the World Trade Organisation, it enhances wealth creation for everyone and serves all the stakeholders in the value chain. &ldquo;However, dumping breaks the rules and, in the process, it unfairly destroys value, jobs and competition. If we want fair competition in international trade we need all participants to trade fairly and according to the international agreements to which their countries are party,&rdquo; said Goldstone.
