Consulting Engineers South Africa (Cesa) on Wednesday added its voice to those that have expressed concern over the latest Cabinet reshuffle and subsequent Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P&rsquo;s) downgrade of South Africa to sub-investment grade. The industry association said the move risked exacerbating an already troubled economic situation and sent a message of &ldquo;rewarding mediocrity and punishing excellence&rdquo;. &ldquo;The latter is counter-intuitive to the culture we seek to establish among young engineering professionals who will be responsible for ensuring the wellbeing of our infrastructure for generations to come,&rdquo; Cesa said in a statement. The country cannot afford this questionable reshuffle based on the need for more &ldquo;effectiveness and efficiency&rdquo;, particularly since a better approach would have been to dispense of the nonperformers and bring on board more performers, it said. &ldquo;The industry is already experiencing difficulty amid corruption, appointment of consulting engineering firms that have little or no record of delivery and even mafia-style criminal activity halting construction activity.&rdquo; The downgrade to junk status further limits investor confidence and hampers economic growth and the ability to create more jobs. &ldquo;Skilled engineering practitioners from various technical disciplines are currently being retrenched at a time when this has been identified as at least six out of the ten most scarce skills in the country,&rdquo; the organisation said.
