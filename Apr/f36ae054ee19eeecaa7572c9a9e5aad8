Finnish stainless steel producer Outokumpu said it expects current quarter profit to be &quot;somewhat&quot; below first-quarter levels due to lower ferrochrome prices and deliveries. Outokumpu&#39;s first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation tripled to &euro;294-million, above the &euro;261-million expected in a Reuters poll helped by stronger prices. Sales rose 27% to &euro;1.76-billion, slightly above the &euro;1.73-billion expected by analysts. &quot;All business areas delivered black numbers,&quot; CEO Roeland Baan said in a statement on Thursday. The company said second-quarter stainless steel deliveries in Europe and the Americas are expected to remain at the same level as in the January-March quarter. Peer US Steel reported disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday, sending its shares down 27%, while European peer Kloeckner reported estimate-beating results on Wednesday. Outokumpu said it remains &quot;well on track&quot; to fulfil its 2020 vision. Shares in Outokumpu were down 2.5% to &euro;9.55 as of 09:29 GMT.
