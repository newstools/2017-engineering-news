Solar rooftop providers All Power Systems and Fusion Energy have formed a new company, Synthesis Power Holdings, to take advantage of the growth in South Africa&rsquo;s solar rooftop energy market. &ldquo;Synthesis was created to provide the ultimate solar rooftop proposition to its clients, one which sets the bar high in every aspect; be it, the funding offerings, design, integration, installation, project management, after-sales support, operations and maintenance and ongoing management and reporting services,&rdquo; Synthesis CEO Jay Naidoo said. The company has targeted equity of R200-million for its initial installations. The company is looking to secure optimum and competitive debt funding from commercial institutions to enhance the offering; however, until it does, it will use pure equity funding for its roll-out. Naidoo believes that commercial rooftop installations within its current model offer an excellent return to equity investors. &ldquo;With&nbsp;an average of eight hours of sun a day,&nbsp;it makes economic sense for businesses to [invest in] photovoltaic solar rooftop panels.&nbsp;Synthesis will provide solar solutions for corporates, shopping centres and other commercial enterprises,&rdquo; he said.
