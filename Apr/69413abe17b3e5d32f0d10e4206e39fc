Construction has started on Tsogo Sun&rsquo;s new R220-million, 125-room StayEasy Maputo Hotel, in Mozambique. The hotel, which will be completed by April 2018, is being built as part of a mixed-use development and will be located above the new Baia Mall that is under construction. &ldquo;The time is right to increase our footprint in this prime tourist destination, which attracts both international and local travellers with its tropical climate, lush scenery, golden beaches, diverse culture and exquisite cuisine,&rdquo; says Tsogo CEO Marcel von Aulock. He adds that the country&rsquo;s growing economy contributed to the group&rsquo;s decision to boost its investment in Maputo. &ldquo;We believe this hotel will hold extra appeal for its exciting location above a lively new mall &ndash; and we look forward to seeing it become a hotel destination of choice for travellers.&rdquo; Tsogo also owns the Southern Sun Maputo Hotel in Mozambique.
