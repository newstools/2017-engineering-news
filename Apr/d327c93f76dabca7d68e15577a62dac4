To further fund research in the renewable-energy space, Eskom will, through its Power Plant Engineering Institute (EPPEI), donate a further R4-million to the Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies (CRSES), based at Stellenbosch University. It donated R2.6-million to CRSES last year. &ldquo;Eskom&rsquo;s unique role in driving socioeconomic growth requires us to work intimately with academic institutions to develop a path-breaking knowledge base in the science environment,&rdquo; Eskom corporate affairs divisional executive Chose Choeu says. The CRSES is also receiving funding from Eskom&rsquo;s Research, Testing and Development business unit for a two-year solar photovoltaic penetration study valued at R2.5-million. &ldquo;Over the period of its tenth academic year, the centre was involved in the graduation of three doctoral, 22 masters and a number of postgraduate diploma students. The centre has also been very successful in attracting additional funding from industry and government,&rdquo; he says. In 2012, EPPEI identified concentrated solar power (CSP) and wind energy as the two focal areas for Eskom in the field of renewable-energy and, subsequently, solar photovoltaics was added. &ldquo;Stellenbosch University has established itself as one of the leading universities in CSP research in the world and has developed a number of unique experimental facilities and technology. Eskom is proud to have made its substantial contribution to this journey,&rdquo; says Choeu. Meanwhile, Eskom also has a multiyear collaborative funding programme with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, contributing R23.4-million. Another R17.5-million in collaborative projects is currently under consideration, says Choeu.
