The leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mmusi Maimane on Tuesday said not a single one of the 14 companies involved in the scandalous upgrades at Nkandla has been blacklisted, or &ldquo;placed on the restricted supplier database&rdquo;. &ldquo;The Minister of Public Works Nathi Nhleko has revealed that 8 of the 14 companies contracted to carry out the infamous upgrades to Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Nkandla homestead have since been rehired by the department to perform other work, notwithstanding their involvement in the R250-million scandal,&rdquo; said Maimane in a statement. The DA leader said Nhleko also confirmed that &ldquo;not a single one&rdquo; of these companies has been blacklisted or &ldquo;placed on the restricted supplier database&rdquo;. Maimane said the public works minister&#39;s reply to a DA written parliamentary question confirmed that from 1 August 2014 to date, the companies in question &ndash; those involved in the Nkandla upgrades &ndash; have been again contracted by the department: &ldquo;This is a shocking revelation considering the Constitutional Court found these upgrades to be fraught with corruption and unlawful enrichment, and once again proves that the more connected and corruptible you are, the more valuable to the ANC government you become, and the more illegitimate money you can make,&rdquo; said Maimane. He said the DA will refer &ldquo;this matter&rdquo; to the Chief Procurement Officer at the National Treasury to immediately intervene and conduct an assessment as to whether any of the companies involved have breached the Supply Chain Management (SCM) policy and/or the National Treasury Regulations. &ldquo;We are adamant that any company or individual who unduly benefitted from carrying out work at Nkandla must be blacklisted and held accountable for their actions,&rdquo; said the DA leader. &ldquo;We also note yesterday&rsquo;s suspicious U-turn by Minister Nhleko, whereby he cancelled a press briefing scheduled for today in which he planned to &lsquo;set the record straight&rsquo; on further upgrades to President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Nkandla homestead. Maimane said no reasons were given for the cancellation. &ldquo;I will therefore be submitting written questions to the minister, seeking an explanation for the proposed new upgrades at Nkandla. &ldquo;I wish to once again make it clear that the DA rejects any new or further upgrades to the President&rsquo;s Nkandla home, regardless of how they are described or categorised by national government. We maintain that not another cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money must be spent at Nkandla for the benefit of one man,&rdquo; Maimane. He said corruption &ldquo;is an evil&rdquo; that enriches the elite at the expense of the poor and the jobless. &ldquo;The DA will not stop until all those who are involved in corruption and any abuse of public funds are held to the highest account.&rdquo; Reacting to weekend media reports, the Presidency on Sunday denied there were any further renovations at taxpayers&rsquo; expense to Zuma&rsquo;s private homestead at Nkandla. &ldquo;The presidency has noted with concern a report in the Sunday Times newspaper about alleged plans by the department of public works to renovate certain aspects of the president&rsquo;s Nkandla residence,&rdquo; the Presidency said. The Presidency said there were no renovations of the private houses at his residence at Nkandla currently and no government department had indicated any proposal for renovations.
