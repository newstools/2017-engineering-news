The South African government seeks to increase the country&rsquo;s investment in research and development (R&amp;D) by 100% from the R29-billion of 2014/2015 to about R60-billion a year by 2020. In terms of percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), this would involve an increase from 0.77% to 1.5%. This was affirmed by Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor at the release of the &#39;R&amp;D Survey 2014/2015&#39; in Pretoria on Wednesday. This is the latest edition of the Department of Science and Technology&rsquo;s (DST&rsquo;s) survey of R&amp;D in South Africa. The survey revealed that R&amp;D investment in the country is on an upward path. It came to R29.3-billion in 2014/2015, which was (in constant 2010 rand terms) an 8.1% increase over the preceding year. This was despite the fact that the country&rsquo;s GDP growth rate was decelerating, from 2.2% in 2013 to 1.5% in 2014. &ldquo;[B]usiness R&amp;D is showing signs of recovery,&rdquo; she highlighted. &ldquo;We wish it was a robust recovery, but it is showing signs of recovery, which is good.&rdquo; (For R&amp;D expenditure purposes, State-owned companies are included in the business sector.) It was, in fact, business R&amp;D that was the main impetus to the rise in national R&amp;D spending. Within business, the main sector driving the increase was manufacturing. However, the business sector which contributes most to R&amp;D is financial and business services, which includes software. The electricity, gas and water supply sectors and the communications, transport and storage sectors, all six of which had previously reported decreases in R&amp;D spending during the previous three surveys, now reported increasing their R&amp;D budgets. The big exception was mining and quarrying, were R&amp;D expenditure fell by 20%. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re concerned that mining and quarrying R&amp;D has decreased,&rdquo; she observed. Nevertheless, the government remains the biggest R&amp;D funder in South Africa. Of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D, 43.9% came from the State. The business sector ranked second, at 40.8%, while foreign sources accounted for 12.2% and other domestic sources for 3.1%. The country&rsquo;s corps of R&amp;D personnel increased to 38 465 in 2014/2015. Some 84% of the new researchers were postgraduate students. The DST believes this is the result of its Research Chairs Initiative and postgraduate bursaries. &ldquo;All in all, the most important trend to observe from the R&amp;D Survey 2014/2015 is that the business sector has replaced the higher education sector as the lead contributor to the increase in R&amp;D spending,&rdquo; pointed out Pandor. &ldquo;Government is working to attract international R&amp;D and to take better advantage of our integration into global R&amp;D value chains.&rdquo; The R&amp;D Survey 2014/2015 was one of two reports released at the same time. The other was the &#39;South African National Survey of Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer at Publicly Funded Research Institutions&#39;.
