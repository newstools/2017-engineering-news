Newly appointed Public Works Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko on Thursday said he was confident that his department would meet its target of creating six-million work opportunities by the end of March 2019. Through its Expanded Public Works Programme the department has, since 2014, created over two-million work opportunities with over a million South African youths being major beneficiaries. In the 2017/18 financial year, the Department of Public Works seeks to create 1.4-million work opportunities under the same programme. &nbsp; &ldquo;The task of tackling youth unemployment and unemployment generally requires not just government, but the collective will and innovation of the private sector as well. &ldquo;I, therefore, urge corporate South Africa to fully embrace and play their part by joining hands with us to help secure our future through creating more opportunities for the skilling and employment of our people. So much is possible if we work towards common and lasting solutions,&rdquo; said Nhleko. &nbsp; He further urged senior managers in his department to work harder in driving the empowerment of young graduates and new entrants in the built environment sector. &ldquo;For radical socioeconomic transformation to be meaningful, the construction and entire built-environment sector must take the lead, especially through skills training for the youth and advancing broad-based black economic empowerment.&rdquo; &nbsp; On May 16, Nhleko will deliver his maiden budget vote in his new portfolio. &nbsp;
