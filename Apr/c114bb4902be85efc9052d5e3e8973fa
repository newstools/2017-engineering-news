Achieving 60% local content on vehicles assembled in South Africa will have a significant impact on the South African economy, including the creation of 49 000 new jobs and the addition of&nbsp;R68-billion&nbsp;to the gross domestic product, says Automotive Masterplan lead and B&amp;M Analysts chairperson Dr Justin Barnes. Speaking at the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers of South Africa (Naacam) show held in Durban this week, he said the development of an Automotive Masterplan was at&nbsp;an &ldquo;advanced stage of development&rdquo; and that more concrete details would be shared over the coming weeks. The Automotive Masterplan is set to replace government&rsquo;s current automotive industry support programme, the Automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), when it comes to an end in 2020. National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers of South Africa (Naacam) president Dave Coffey&nbsp;noted that it had been accepted by industry role-players that there was a need to increase&nbsp;local content in manufactured vehicles from the current level of 38.5% to 60%. &ldquo;Given the fact that approximately triple the number of jobs are created in component manufacturing than in vehicle assembly, there is commitment across the board to deepen levels of local content.&nbsp;This responsibility falls as much with tier one component manufacturers as it does with [vehicle manufacturers].&rdquo; &nbsp; Trade and Industry Minister Dr&nbsp;Rob Davies reaffirmed government&rsquo;s support for&nbsp;the automotive sector. &nbsp; &ldquo;I was really pleased to see a vast array of component suppliers at the show, showing the depth and breadth of the supply chain, including black industrialists, a number of whom have entered the space with support from [vehicle manufacturers] and large tier one suppliers,&rdquo; he added. &nbsp; Davies said any beneficiary of future automotive policies would need to demonstrate contribution to black-supplier development and localisation, which was &ldquo;central&nbsp;to dealing with stubbornly high unemployment levels&rdquo;. Coffey added that all South African automotive role-players understood that transformation and the inclusion of black-owned suppliers in the value chain was not negotiable.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a renewed sense of urgency and move to action, in this regard, which is significant. It is not business as usual.&rdquo; &nbsp; Toyota South Africa Motors president and National Association of Automotive Manufacturers of South Africa representative at the show, Andrew Kirby, said he was encouraged that the industry had aligned regarding &ldquo;the overall picture of the masterplan and the acceptance of its key targets for the sector&rdquo;. &nbsp;
