The rehabilitation of 7 km of the N2 between Borcherds Quarry road and the R300, in the Western Cape, is 75% complete. The R186-million project, which is being undertaken by the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) and on which work started in January 2016, is expected to be completed in September. This project includes the rehabilitation of the existing middle and left lanes, the construction of the final riding surface, the installation of street lighting and road marking. It also includes the introduction of a third lane. &ldquo;Once completed, this project is expected to benefit the 82&nbsp;000 vehicles that travel on this section of the N2 every day. The upgrade will improve the carrying capacity of the road, especially for buses and taxis during peak periods. Ride quality, safety and visibility will all be improved,&rdquo; the DTPW said in a statement.
