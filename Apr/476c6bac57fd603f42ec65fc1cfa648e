German logistics company Hermes and Mercedes-Benz&nbsp;Vans have agreed on a strategic partnership to electrify the courier service&rsquo;s vehicle fleet. Under this agreement, Hermes will use battery-electric vehicles in its normal operations in a pilot phase in Stuttgart and Hamburg, in Germany, in early 2018. The focus will be on testing the economy, sustainability and practicality of emission-free vans when used for last mile deliveries. By the end of 2020, Hermes&nbsp;Germany says it intends to deploy 1 500 Mercedes-Benz Vito and Sprinter electric vans in urban areas across Germany. &ldquo;Electric drive is a key technology for urban transport, especially in commercial use. Last-mile deliveries must become more efficient and, in specific applications, emission-free,&rdquo; says Mercedes-Benz&nbsp;Vans head Volker Mornhinweg. &ldquo;Last year, we announced that we will put a Mercedes-Benz electric van into series production again. Our first one was in 2011. We are proud that we can announce that Hermes will be our first customer, and with a significant number of vehicles at that. &ldquo;This is a specific implementation of our plans for tailored industry solutions in cooperation with our customers. Hermes requires mid-size and large vans with electric drive for its applications. We can meet both needs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Electric mobility plays a key role as part of our long-term strategy for climate and environmental protection,&rdquo; adds Hermes&nbsp;Germany CEO Frank Rausch. Hermes aims for emission-free deliveries in the inner-city areas of all major German cities by 2025. &nbsp;
