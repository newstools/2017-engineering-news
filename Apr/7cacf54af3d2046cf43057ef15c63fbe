Rteurns in the South African property investment sector hit the lowest level since 2009 after falling from 13% in 2015 to 11.1% in 2016, a 190 basis point decline, the latest IPD South Africa Annual Property Index shows. NYSE-listed MSCI, which compiled the report, noted this week that &ldquo;it was hardly&rdquo; surprising, as commercial property returns closely track the general economy; however, the sector has delivered consistently since the inception of the index in 1995. The index shows 2016 income returns remaining steady at 8.3%, while capital growth fell from 4.4% in 2015 to 2.6% in the year under review, with an improved base rental growth of 6.2% offset by negative yield impact. &ldquo;Even given the decline in total returns, the sector has once again proven its resilience by providing real returns in 2016,&rdquo; said MSCI executive director Phil Barttram, pointing out that investors have benefited from stable incomes, founded on the sectors&rsquo; contractual income base and aggressive cost management. Overall, industrial property was the top performing sector during the year with a total return of 13.6%, outperforming retail at 12.6%, while the office sector continued to struggle on the back of subdued capital growth and was particularly hard hit in 2016 with a total return of 7.6%, he noted. At a property segment level, inner city and decentralised offices were among the worst performing segments for the year with total returns of 7.5% and 7.7% respectively, the report showed. &ldquo;The top performing segments for the year were high-tech industrial property and neighbourhood shopping centres, which produced total returns of 18.1% and 20.3% respectively. &ldquo;The index results show that the performance of the South African property investment sector continues to hold up well despite the prevailing low gross domestic product growth environment,&rdquo; added Nedbank CIB property finance managing executive Robin Lockhart-Ross. The IPD South Africa Annual Index, which has outperformed the MSCI SA Equities Index and the JP Morgan Bond Index over one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods, was sponsored by Nedbank Corportate and Investment Bank and is based on asset level data collected from a sample of 1 450 properties with a total capital value of R296.6-billion as at December 31, 2016.
