The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) on Monday said construction upgrades on the M1 freeway&rsquo;s Oxford and Federation bridges will enter the third and final phase in May. The R127-million project is 75% complete, with the majority of fill and stabilisation of underground conditions completed on the southbound section. &ldquo;A 3 km stormwater drainage system on the freeway between Rockridge Bridge and Federation Bridge is being upgraded, as well as Oxford and Federation Bridge below the freeway,&rdquo; JRA MD Dr Sean Phillips said at a media briefing, in Johannesburg, on Monday. He added that the application of protective coatings is also under way and work will now move to the northbound section of the M1, necessitating a switchover of lanes. &ldquo;Further traffic disruptions should be expected,&rdquo; he warned drivers. The JRA pointed out that, as from the start of May, two lanes of the M1 will be open in each direction, while the Ettrick road onramp (southbound) will reopen and the Oxford road offramp (northbound) will close. Also speaking at the briefing Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said a high-quality road network was an essential element of a prosperous and thriving city that was able to attract much-needed investment and move people, services and goods effectively across the city. &ldquo;The essential rehabilitation of our ageing M1 freeway and bridge infrastructure is a major project to improve mobility in Johannesburg for school learners, employees, taxi and bus drivers and the 80 000 vehicle owners who use the freeway daily,&rdquo; she said. She added that when investors take decisions on whether they will expand their businesses into specific cities or regions, they always enquire about the quality of available infrastructure.
