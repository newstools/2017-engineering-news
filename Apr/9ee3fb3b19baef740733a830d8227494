JOHANNESBURG &ndash; South Africa&#39;s state-owned power producer Eskom will meet with Exxaro Resources after the coal producer approved a transaction that will see its black ownership drop to 30% from over 50%, the utility said on Wednesday. The diversified miner said in November it planned to replace its existing ownership structure through a share buyback process that would dilute its black ownership. The ownership issue is important because Eskom&#39;s policy requires new contracts with suppliers that have more than a 50% black shareholding. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said old contracts such as Exxaro&#39;s would not be affected but it was seeking a meeting with the company about the issue. &quot;We are suggesting that we should have a meeting very soon,&quot; he said. A spokesperson for Exxaro declined to comment beyond saying the company anticipated a meeting with Eskom shortly. Shares in Exxaro were 3.6% lower in late Johannesburg trade. Government and mining companies have often been at odds over the issue of &quot;black economic empowerment&quot;, known locally as BEE, which was established to redress the imbalances of white apartheid rule. The Chamber of Mines, which represents several mining companies, expressed concern over a revised draft of the mining charter, which seeks to establish a new regulatory agency and impose social development targets on the industry based on revenues.
