TRIPOLI &ndash; An armed group has again blocked gas pipelines from Libya&#39;s Wafa oilfield to a local power plant and the Mellitah gas export terminal on the coast, a source from state energy firm NOC said on Friday. The NOC earlier this week lifted a force majeure on Wafa and said its pipelines were open after sources said tribal leaders had negotiated a deal with an armed group that closed lines there for about a month. The Wafa closure is part of broader disruptions of Libya&#39;s oil production, which since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 has been hit by the country&#39;s factional infighting, Islamic State militant attacks and political protests.
