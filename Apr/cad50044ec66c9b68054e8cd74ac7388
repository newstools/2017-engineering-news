Activity in South Africa&#39;s private sector expanded for a seventh straight month in March as output and new orders rose, leading companies to increase inventories, a survey showed on Wednesday. The Standard Bank Purchasing Managers&#39; Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, edged up to 50.7 from 50.5 from February, remaining above the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction for the longest stretch in more than four years. The latest figure was broadly in line with the long-run survey average of 50.8. But it showed only marginal improvement in business conditions, as new export orders continued to decline. &quot;The accelerated expansion in March&#39;s PMI was supported by improvements in key demand and supply subindices, as well as stocks of purchases, which continues to support the idea that economic activity may have troughed,&quot; said Kim Silberman, an economist at Standard Bank. &quot;It is possible that the survey results are reflecting slight demand-driven inflation pressures, with output prices having risen at a slightly faster rate despite input price inflation having slowed,&quot; Silberman said. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy shrank by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of 2016 as mining and manufacturing output shrank, and it looks set to stumble even further after S&amp;P cut the country&#39;s credit level to &quot;junk&quot; on Monday. S&amp;P said the dismissal of the country&#39;s respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, by President Jacob Zuma heralded a damaging policy shift and that economic growth and fiscal outcomes could suffer. Fitch and Moody&#39;s also warned of possible downgrades over the political upheaval, with the latter saying on Monday it was placing South Africa on review for a downgrade.
