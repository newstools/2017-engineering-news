President Jacob Zuma pledged on Thursday to redistribute wealth in the economy to poor black people as part of a policy he calls &quot;radical socio-economic transformation&quot;. &quot;We mean the fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of South Africans, especially the poor,&quot; Zuma said in a speech to members of local government. Zuma&#39;s fresh &quot;transformation&quot; pledge has been criticised by opponents who say it is a populist attempt to win votes and vague rhetoric similar to many promises made since the end of apartheid in 1994.
