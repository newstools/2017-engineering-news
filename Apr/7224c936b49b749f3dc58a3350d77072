JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Competition Commission has recommended that the Competition Tribunal approve the proposed buyout by K2015356066 (Newco) of the ferrochrome production assets of ASA Metals. Newco is a newly created joint venture between Sinosteel and Samancor. Sinosteel operates globally in the production, supply and procurement of a range of commodity products, primarily focused on the production and supply of steel. &ldquo;The proposed transaction is unlikely to substantially prevent or lessen competition in the market for the production and supply of ferrochrome. In addition, there are no public interest concerns,&rdquo; the commission said.
