Murray &amp; Roberts (M&amp;R) Water and Australian-based Osmoflo have concluded a memorandum of agreement to offer emergency desalination plants in South Africa. Through its agreement with Osmoflo, M&amp;R Water has four 7 000 m3/d sea water desalination plants that are immediately available to the drought stricken areas of South Africa. Each plant can provide potable water to more than 40 000 people daily. &ldquo;Osmoflo has a business model built around supplying water treatment solutions during emergency situations and owning assets that can be rapidly deployed. These plants are currently being offered to municipalities in Cape Town and other coastal areas to assist with the challenging conditions residents are facing,&rdquo; M&amp;R water operations executive Harry Singeton said in a statement. Osmoflo has one of the largest fleets of emergency water treatment equipment, ranging from sea water and brackish water desalination plants, filtration, wastewater and chemical dosing plants, as well as other ancillary plant to complement any emergency water requirement. &ldquo;We are aware of the dire situation facing some municipalities in South Africa and we have the equipment available to provide immediate potable water assistance,&rdquo; Osmoflo rental manager Bobby Watson said. M&amp;R Water and Osmoflo will be offering similar solutions to the South African mining sector that will include Osmoflo&rsquo;s patented brine squeezer&nbsp;technology, which offers high-recovery mine water treatment.
