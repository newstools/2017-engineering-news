	General Electric (GE) Steam Power Systems has received a final acceptance certificate from State-owned Eskom for the successful testing and transitioning of Unit 4 at the Medupi power station.
	 
	Unit 4 is the third of six units to be transferred to commercial operation, marking the halfway point of completing the project. 
	Once completed in 2020, Medupi will be the fourth-largest coal-fired power plant in the world and the largest in Africa.  
	GE’s scope of work includes six full engineering, procurement and construction turbine islands, air cooled condensers and overall project and construction management.
	 
	“Our team has been working with Eskom on the Medupi power station since 2007 and our collaboration has achieved significant progress with more than just power supply in South Africa. We have invested over R1-billion to empower local businesses and trained over 300 students on technical and engineering skills,” Medupi project director Douglas Beigley said.
	 
	He added that this investment solidified GE’s long-term commitment to the country’s National Development Plan.  
	“Medupi is a shining example of how Africa’s power generation needs can be solved through successful public–private sector collaboration.”
