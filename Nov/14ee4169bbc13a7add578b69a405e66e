	Following Michael Sachs’ request to be transferred to other areas of public service earlier this month, the National Treasury Budget Office has appointed Ian Stuart to succeed Sachs as acting deputy director-general. 
	Stuart is currently the chief director for fiscal policy in the Budget Office within the National Treasury, a position he has held since August 2015. 
	The primary role of the fiscal policy unit is to set the fiscal stance. This requires extensive technical knowledge of the budget, together with strong writing and presentation skills for public engagements. 
	In his position, Stuart was the lead author on fiscal policy matters for South African Budget documents and the Budget speech; and Public Financial Management Adviser for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
	He joined the National Treasury in 2006 as a senior policy analyst and worked closely with Sachs.
