	South African real estate investment trusts (Reits) rank high among the country’s companies that earn the most for shareholders.
	 
	The sector featured strongly overall in the list of the Top 100 Companies on the JSE for performance. South African Reits made up a significant 12% of the Top 100 Companies over five years based on a compound annual growth rate.
	 
	“The sector has held up well, despite the current negative sentiment. It remains the best income producer, a defensive investment through cycles and a powerful shield against inflation,” South Africa Reit Association chairperson Izak Petersen said in a statement issued on Monday.
	 
	The association represents South Africa’s listed Reit sector and its members comprise all listed South African Reits. 
	Currently, there are 31 Reits listed on the JSE, with a combined market capitalisation of over R422-billion. 
	 
	Leading the listed property sector, and third overall, was Fortress Income Fund. 
	Other top performing Reits included in the Top 100 Companies are Resilient Reit, Fairvest Property Holdings, Dipula Income Fund B, SA Corporate Real Estate Fund, Hyprop Investments, Arrowhead Properties, Oasis Crescent Property Fund, Hospitality Fund B, Octodec Investments, Redefine Properties and Emira Property Fund.
	 
	“The sector’s strong showing among South Africa’s top listed investments and its positive performance record are reasons that any serious investor should regard meaningful exposure to listed property as essential,” Peterson noted.
