	The Benin government has ordered MTN Benin CEO Stephen Blewett to leave the country within seven days. 
	Blewett, who has lived in the country since 2015, on Friday received official notification to exit the country by November 24 on the basis of his alleged engagement in “activities detrimental to security and public order” – allegations refuted by MTN. 
	This followed a week after MTN received notification from the telecommunications regulator Arcep for a review into nonpayment of outstanding frequency fees of about $213-million for the period March 2016 to December 2017. 
	“MTN has taken note of the government’s concerns; however, refutes these allegations. Blewett will abide by the government’s request and will leave Benin by the date stipulated by local authorities,” the company said in a statement on Friday. 
	MTN assured that Blewett discharged his duties as directed by MTN Group with the “utmost integrity” and in accordance with the laws of Benin.
