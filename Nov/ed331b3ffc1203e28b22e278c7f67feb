	The $294-million Kariba dam rehabilitation project (KDRP) is progressing steadily, with the plunge pool currently in the implementation phase and the spillway refurbishment works under procurement, the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) said on Friday. 
	The authority, which operates, maintains and manages the Kariba dam on behalf of the governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe, hosted its sixth technical joint mission of multiple stakeholders directly involved in the implementation of the KDRP, at Siavonga, Zambia, in early November. 
	Speaking at the joint mission, ZRA CEO Munyaradzi Munodawafa noted that the project was still on track to be completed in 2025.
	
	Site establishment for the plunge pool reshaping, which includes the construction of the site offices, accommodation and workshops, was well under way, with the construction of the access road to the plunge pool being imminent, following agreement on the proposed route of the road.
	
	Meanwhile, the tender launch date for the spillway refurbishment works was expected to be opened in December, allowing for the works contract to be awarded by mid-2018. 
	The Kariba dam is one of Africa’s most iconic dams and, in 2018, the ZRA is celebrating the dam’s sixtieth anniversary.
