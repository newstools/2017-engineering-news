	A new water crisis initiative has been launched to identify and push through three multibillion-rand projects to restore water security to Cape Town. 
	The launch followed a meeting in Cape Town, headed by the Water Leapathon Advisory Board, a strategy forum that brings together representatives from business, academia, government, labour and concerned citizens. 
	“In the short term, we will help with getting the message across and help mobilise businesses and individuals to take steps to cut water consumption,” Cape Messenger CEO Martin Humphries said in a statement on Tuesday. 
	Humphries, who chaired the meeting, said that, in the long term, three megaprojects would be identified. 
	“We are not tied to any strategy, if water treatment or reuse is the best and cheapest way to go, we will follow that path,” he noted, adding that large-scale desalination was also an option. 
	A water Leapathon emergency summit will be held in Cape Town at the end of November to advance the agenda. 
	“The technology is available and funding can be raised. If there is red tape, it must not be allowed to hold us back,” Humphries said.
