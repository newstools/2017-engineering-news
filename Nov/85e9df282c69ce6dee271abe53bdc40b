	Angola Cables plans to establish a second point of presence (PoP) in South Africa as it continues to expand its presence since entering the market a year ago. 
	By the end of this year, the group will launch a new PoP in Cape Town to further expand its network reach, attend to local Internet and content demand and enhance peering capabilities. 
	“Increasing demand has resulted in Angola Cables’ decision to develop a PoP for customers based, or with operations in, Cape Town,” said Angola Cables product manager Darwin Cost. 
	Angola Cables opened its first South Africa-based PoP infrastructure at Teraco, in Johannesburg, in December last year. 
	The second PoP comes after nearly a year of operations in South Africa, with the company experiencing exponential growth in its customer base.
