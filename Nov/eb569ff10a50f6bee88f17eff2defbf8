	The City of Johannesburg (CoJ) has revealed it will need around R12.65-billion over the next ten years to renew and replace the city’s ageing and decrepit water infrastructure. 
	Joburg Water is in the process of building nine new water reservoirs and towers that will serve 163 800 households in areas including Blue Hills, Woodmead, Halfway House, Lawley and Doornkop West. 
	Funds will also be allocated for the renewal and replacement of 633 km of water pipes and 456 km of sewer pipes. 
	However, the city’s water entity firstly needs to secure the funds to upgrade water and sewer capacity, water pump stations, rehabilitate reservoirs, replace water pipes and refurbish wastewater treatment works plant. 
	The ageing infrastructure is further being exacerbated by theft, CoJ environment and infrastructure services MEC Nico de Jager said at a media briefing on Wednesday. 
	“Theft of brass water meters is increasing and costing the city a lot of money. During the 2016/17 financial year, around 4 004 brass meters were stolen. Joburg Water is working closely with community policing forums for increased police visibility to assist with curbing the theft of meters.”
	
	The city is also considering establishing first-line response teams to assist in reducing time of water wastage when pipe bursts occur to reduce the direct cost of these leaks.
