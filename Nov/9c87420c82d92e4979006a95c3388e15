French firm EDF has contracted Bouygues Travaux Publics, a subsidiary of Bouygues Construction, in a consortium with British company Laing O&rsquo;Rourke, to construct the buildings that will house the two European Pressurised Reactor (ERP) nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, England. Bouygues Construction&rsquo;s share of this contract will amount to at least &euro;1.7-billion. &ldquo;We are proud to have been selected by EDF for this extraordinary project, a choice that reflects Bouygues Construction&rsquo;s expertise in the field of nuclear civil engineering,&rdquo; said Bouygues Construction CEO Philippe Bonnave. Britain approved the construction of the $24-billion nuclear power plant project in September 2016. EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corp are building the twin EPR reactors with a total capacity of 3.2 GW. Hinkley Point C will supply 7% of the UK&rsquo;s electricity consumption, providing power for more than five-million homes.
