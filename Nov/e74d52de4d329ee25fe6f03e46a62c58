	JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The board of platinum mining company Lonmin has decided to extend the date of the publication of its 2017 financial results to afford management the opportunity to give undivided attention to the group’s operational review, which is targeting a viable business plan based on the possible raising of new debt capital, continued lender support and the potential disposal of assets. 
	The company’s decision to extend its reporting date to beyond November 13 coincides with an improved production performance by the resilient London- and Johannesburg-listed company, which has lifted sales for the financial year to September 30 to 706 030 oz, well above guidance of between 650 000 oz and 680 000 oz. 
	“We’re pleased with the progress,” Lonmin CEO Ben Magara, who is doubling as COO, said on Friday, his comment arising at a time of a higher rand basket price for the company than when it made its operational review announcement on August 7. 
	During his days as COO of New Denmark Colliery in the 2000s, Magara saved the coal mine from closure and eventually doubled employment. 
	At Lonmin, he has wound down high cost production and extracted cost benefit from the company’s mines which are 600 m below surface on average compared to the industry’s 900 m to 1 000 m average. 
	Currently, the board believes that the company’s growing net cash position, which rose to $103-million from $75-million in March, provides adequate liquidity to fund the business through the review process, which witnessed Lonmin’s three core Generation 3 shafts K3, Rowland and Saffy delivering 13.4% more ore in the three months to September 30. 
	K3 was up 20.3% for the fourth quarter, with its August production of 293 000 t the highest since 2013, Saffy’s fourth quarter production was the highest in its history, and Rowland’s third quarter production was the highest since 2011. 
	Fourth-quarter unit costs were held to a 4.3%-higher R11 524/platinum group metal ounce on a six element basis and the fatality-free quarter was supported by 9.1% better safety.
