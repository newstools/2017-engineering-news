	The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has reopened the tender process for the construction of the R1.7-billion Msikaba bridge, in the Eastern Cape. 
	 
	The bridge, located about 23 km east of Lusikisiki, in the Eastern Cape, forms part of the backbone of the greenfield portion of the N2 Wild Coast Road – a national priority under coordination and direction of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission and one of government’s 18 strategic integrated projects to support economic development and address service delivery in the poorest provinces.  
	Once complete, the bridge will be the longest span cable-stayed suspension bridge in South Africa and the second-longest in Africa.  
	The previous tender for the construction of the bridge had been cancelled, as no acceptable tenders had been received.
	 
	“The retendering process is now open and we are confident that this round of tendering will be successful,” Sanral communications manager Vusi Mona said on Friday.
	 
	The tender process for the 580 m bridge, which will cross the 195-m-deep Msikaba river gorge, will close in March 2018. Construction is expected to start in the second half of 2018 and will be completed within about 33 months. 
	Sanral has invited all firms or consortiums that have relevant experience in the construction of major bridges, particularly cable stay bridges, and that have experienced staff and the financial stability to undertake the three-year contract, to participate in the tender. 
	To participate, firms must have a broad-based black economic empowerment scorecard of Level 4 or higher.
