	The cheetah is renowned for being the world's fastest mammal, but is also one of its most endangered species. 
	Organisers of the environmentally friendly Formula E racing series recently set up a race between one of their cars and a tame cheetah to highlight the impact of climate change on the African predator. 
	With an acceleration of 0-100 kph (62 mph) the cheetah is about as quick off the line as the Techeetah team's racing car, and their French driver Jean-Eric Vergne - winner of July's Montreal E-Prix - agreed to take on an apparently tame four-footed opponent in a drag race. 
	Video provided by Formula E shows the cheetah taking a lead off the line but eventually losing narrowly to the car, which has a top speed of 225 kph (139 mph) compared to the animal's maximum of about 112 kpm (70mph). 
	According to the World Wildlife Fund the cheetah is endangered due to a loss of habitat, reduced prey and direct persecution. It is listed as 'vulnerable' in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species, which says only about 6 700 remain in the wild. 
	A graphic at the end of the short film, which was shot on a landing strip in a remote part of South Africa's Western Cape, assures viewers no animals were abused or mistreated in the production.Â
