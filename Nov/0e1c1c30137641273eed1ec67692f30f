	WesBank, a division of First Rand Bank, has concluded an agreement with Haval Motors South Africa (HMSA) to provide finance products for the brand’s expanding customer base in South Africa. 
	The Chinese vehicle manufacturer Great Wall Motors (GWM) has traded in South Africa since 2007. 
	Its product range includes GWM pick-ups, sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and passenger cars and, since its introduction in May this year, GWM’s premium SUV brand, Haval. 
	“Choosing to partner with WesBank was a clear-cut decision,” says HMSA MD Charles Zhao. 
	“With WesBank as the number one vehicle and asset financial services provider in South Africa and Haval Motors being an SUV leader, we believe that both parties offer a significant all-round value proposition for the South African consumer.” 
	The agreement will provide consumers entry to WesBank’s self-service portals that allow for access to settlement quotes and eNATIS certificates, says HMSA. 
	Haval and GWM will also work closely with WesBank to provide a range of finance and insurance products that could potentially drive increased sales in South Africa. 
	“We at WesBank are excited by the prospect of working with Haval and GWM,” notes WesBank Motor CEO Mark Finlayson. 
	“As a market leader in vehicle finance that has built strong automotive finance alliances, we believe that by combining our solid value offering with the leading Chinese brand, which is aggressively growing its presence in the country, we can offer the customer a unique experience.”
