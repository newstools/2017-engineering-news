	A R120-million, 469-bed student accommodation development built by Respublica Student Living Fund, in Bloemfontein, will be ready for occupation in January 2018.
	 
	The residence includes 58 apartments, each with eight single rooms, two bathrooms, a lounge/dining area and communal kitchen. 
	The residence also offers a thoughtfully designed apartment suited to accommodate up to five physically disabled students.
	 
	“This is our first residence project in Bloemfontein and we are looking forward to welcoming students from the University of the Free State and other tertiary institutions within the city through our doors,” says Respublica CEO Craig McMurray. 
	 
	Spread across five low-rise buildings, including a communal block that houses the canteen, study and recreation areas, a gym, laundry, swimming pool and outdoor social areas, the residence is within easy walking distance of the University of the Free State entrance.
	 
	Respublica aims to offer accommodation that is affordable to most students. Students pay a fully inclusive rate, which covers costs for parking, laundry, uncapped WiFi and weekly bedroom cleans. 
	 
	All Respublica residences include a computer lab and study rooms, a gym, a games room, a chill room, laundry facilities and a swimming pool.
	 
	Biometric access control supported by 24-hour access to armed response ensures security peace of mind.
