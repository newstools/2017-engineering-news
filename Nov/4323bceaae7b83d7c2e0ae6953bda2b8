	Corruption amounting to R16.2-billion across 2 469 cases, now under investigation, has been uncovered over the past year by the City of Johannesburg’s anticorruption crackdown. 
	Since inception, the Group Forensic and Investigations Department had implemented measures to clamp down on fraud and corruption, which executive mayor Herman Mashaba said had been allowed to run rampant across the city. 
	“We have taken aggressive actions against those implicated. Over 600 people have been arrested and more than 100 employees of the city have been suspended, 13 employees have resigned and seven [have been] dismissed,” said Mashaba. 
	Despite the high levels of corruption, he was confident that the situation was under control and the perpetrators were being brought to book. 
	Group Forensic and Investigations is working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as the South African Police Service, the National Prosecuting Authority, intelligence structures, the Asset Forfeiture Unit, Home Affairs and other key stakeholders like companies and the Intellectual Property Commission. 
	“The ethical and moral actions of our officials at all levels, play a critical role in the fight against fraud and corruption in the city. Fraud and corruption undermine service delivery in the city. In principle, corruption eroded the confidence and trust that the society had in our officials and governments as whole,” he said. 
	Mashaba also commented that the city was lobbying the national government to allow municipalities like the City of Johannesburg to establish their own municipal courts and prisons.
