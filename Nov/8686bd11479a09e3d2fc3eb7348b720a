	Over 81 927 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) passed through the Ngqura Container Terminal (NCT), in the Eastern Cape, in October, the highest number handled in the terminal’s history. 
	This milestone not only bodes well for the economy of the region and the country, but also shows impressive volume performance despite abnormally adverse weather conditions that affected service delivery to clients and sluggish economic growth that is impacting on imports and exports. 
	“We are delighted that the terminal was able to handle this kind of volume while overcoming a number of challenges. It was a team effort that allowed us to reach this milestone,” said NCT acting terminal manager Wandisa Vazi. 
	Nineteen per cent of the volumes handled were imports, 18% were exports and 63% were transshipments. 
	“We are grateful for the support that our customers and stakeholders have afforded us. It further cements the shared vision of both Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) and customers to growing volumes whenever an opportunity presents itself. 
	“We are also encouraged by the increase in the transshipment volumes, which is testament to the fact that NCT is ideally positioned to service the east and west markets,” TPT Eastern Cape Terminals GM Siya Mhlaluka highlighted. 
	Since starting operations in 2009, the NCT has complemented the South African port system as a transshipment hub. The terminal has increased South African trade with the world, generating much-needed jobs in the economy while promoting international trade for Southern African Development Community countries.
