	BAIC South Africa (SA) has appointed Batandwa Mdyesha CFO, with immediate effect. 
	She was previously the CFO of State-owned mining company African Exploration Mining and Finance Corporation. 
	“We look forward to welcoming Mdyesha to our South African operation; we wish her well in this senior leadership role, and look forward to her strategic and leadership contributions to make our South African and African operations successful,” BAIC International VP Li Xiaofan said in a statement on Monday. 
	The company was recently listed in the Fortune Global 500 for the fifth consecutive year. 
	“The latest ranking fully reflects [the] powerful growth momentum of BAIC, which will also be felt on the African continent, through exports,” he said. 
	Commenting on the construction of BAIC’s vehicle manufacturing plant, in Port Elizabeth, Mdyesha said major construction contracts were at an advanced stage of being awarded, with a portion of the work set aside for small, medium-sized and microenterprises. 
	“At present, we are working hard to ensure that the greenfield investment of our new automotive plant has a meaningful impact and effect in Nelson Mandela Bay,” she said. 
	The BAIC plant will add around 800 new jobs to the metro’s economy once the plant is operational and it is estimated that a further 10 000 jobs will be created throughout the automotive value chain.
