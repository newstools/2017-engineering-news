	“We are very excited to be launching our satellite office. During our annual stakeholder roadshows, East London was the most vocal about the fact that we were not accessible – not only to our registered persons but [also to] those that wish to register with us,” said CEO Sipho Madonsela. 
	He added that Ecsa exists to mainly to regulate the engineering profession by registering engineers, setting standards for engineering education, ensuring adherence to the code of conduct and accrediting institutions that offer engineering programmes. 
	Through the facilitation of ELIDZ, the launch created a platform for Ecsa to engage with various stakeholders from manufacturing organisations, institutions of higher learning and government departments about possible solutions to skills development in the fields of science, technology and engineering. 
	The dialogue was aimed at creating a forum that unpacked issues pertaining to the science and engineering industries, as well as to establish collaborations that will enable the implementation of solutions in the form of tangible projects.
