	The University of the Witswatersrand (Wits) announced on Thursday that it had appointed former Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan as a visiting professor at the Wits School of Governance, as from Friday. 
	“He has played an integral role in South Africa’s history and we believe that his strong experience, sound public financial management and principled stand on good governance and transformation of the economy will add substantial value to the academic programme,” said Wits School of Governance head Professor David Everatt. 
	He added that Gordhan’s strong views on corruption and financial mismanagement were the values that the university wanted to impress upon their students, many of whom serve in the public sector. 
	Gordhan has become increasingly outspoken about government corruption since he was fired by President Jacob Zuma in a Cabinet reshuffle at the end of March. 
	The Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management dean Professor Imraan Valodia said this was a substantial appointment that boded well for the faculty. 
	He went on to say that the appointment would strengthen the faculty’s cohort of stalwarts. 
	Wits Vice-Chancellor and Principal Professor Adam Habib hailed Gordhan’s successful track record in management of the public service. 
	“The skill sets that he has acquired through his years of managerial experience will be the basis of rich learning for the University and its students,” he said. 
	Gordhan will join the likes of former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene who is an interim director of the Wits Business School, former ANC chief whip Max Sisulu and former Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni who serve at Wits.
