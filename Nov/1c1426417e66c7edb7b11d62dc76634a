	The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has published its draft Number Portability Regulations for public comment. 
	This followed a review, completed in March, that showed while number portability has positively evolved in South Africa since its launch more than ten years ago, mobile portability has yet to realise its full potential. 
	The Number Portability Findings Report highlighted that the South African market has changed in many respects since 2006, with portability now facing new challenges that need to be dealt with, and while number portability is functioning well overall, it does require closer monitoring. 
	The inquiry aimed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current number portability framework; the impact of the current number portability framework on licensees and the general public; if there are regulatory gaps arising from the market and regulatory development; and what regulatory interventions would be necessary. 
	Icasa noted that the draft regulations sought to ensure effective functionality of number portability; that number portability occurs in an efficient manner without delays or disruption of services; access and routing of communication despite a number being ported; and that service providers provide mechanisms to address cost allocation and cost recovery among licensees with regards to number portability. 
	Stakeholders had 30 days from November 24 to make their written submissions. 
	Number portability is the process that enables end-users to retain their telephone numbers when changing from one network operator to another.Â
