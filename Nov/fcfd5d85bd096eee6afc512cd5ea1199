	The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has published a second draft of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulations for public input. 
	Interested stakeholders have until January 3 to submit their written comments, following which Icasa will host public hearings from February 7 to 9. 
	The final regulations will be promulgated by March 31. 
	Icasa first published the draft in August, attracting an initial 20 public submissions, in a review of consumer protection regulations. 
	The regulations form part of Icasa’s short, medium and long-term interventions to ensure greater transparency of communication services and also to bring down the cost of communication in South Africa. 
	“The review of the regulations was necessitated by general concerns raised by various stakeholders, including consumer groups and social media campaigns, with regards to data expiry rules, high out-of-bundle rates and rules and also out-of-bundle voice and SMS rules currently applied by licensees,” Icasa councillor Botlenyana Mokhele said. 
	“The purpose of these regulations is to protect the rights of consumers by, among others, ensuring that end-users are provided with sufficient information that will assist them in making informed decisions; as well as facilitate redress for end-users who have been unfairly treated, where applicable.” 
	The draft regulations propose all licensees provide unused prepaid data bundles with a minimum expiry period of three years; send use notifications for data depletion to end-users at 50%, 75%, 90% and 100% intervals; and provide an option to post-paid users to roll over unused monthly data allocation to the next billing period or to transfer the monthly data allocation or a portion thereof to another end-user on the same network.
