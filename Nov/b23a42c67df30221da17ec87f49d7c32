While new-vehicle sales were down 11.4% in 2016 in a tough-as-nails domestic economy, Ferrari sales grew from 91 units in 2015, to 94 prancing horses finding new homes in 2016. Maserati had an ever better year. South African sales grew from 45 units in 2015, to 113 in 2016. Germany&rsquo;s Porsche continued to outnumber the Italians on the road, however, with sales of 1 430 units, holding steady on 2015 sales of 1 469 units. Porsche importer Toby Venter&rsquo;s new Bentley venture notched up sales of 41 super-luxury vehicles since May. Ford&rsquo;s introduction of the Mustang proved successful, with sales of 860 units in its first year on the South African market. While sports-car sales may prove that the Camps Bay and Houghton set remain alive and well, it appears as if South Africa&rsquo;s green conscience has waned alongside the diminishing threat of load-shedding. Nissan could only sell seven Leaf electric vehicles this year, compared with 35 in 2015. BMW&rsquo;s i3 had a better year, though, with sales of 76 units, compared with 82 in 2015. Electric vehicles receive no government incentives in South Africa, contrary to the case in a large number of developed countries. The ever popular bakkie segment was again won by the Toyota Hilux, at 35 428 units, with the Ford Ranger three thousand units behind, at 32 468 units. Most certainly consumers, and the economy, have been on the winning end of the friendly rivalry between the US and Japanese brands. Both the Hilux and Ranger are produced in South Africa. Importers again faced a tough year as the rand remained weak against major currencies, forcing their hand on above-inflation price increases. Two South African importers, Associated Motor Holdings (AMH) and Amalgamated Automobile Distributors, have seen their combined sales drop from 77 019 units in 2013, to 69 750 units in 2014, 59 478 new vehicles in 2015, and 53 877 units in 2016. AMH, part of the Imperial group, imports the Kia and Hyundai brands. Another interesting fact of 2016 has been the rise of Quantum sales, with the perennial minibus taxi industry favourite jumping from 11 894-unit sales in 2015 to 15 004 units last year. * The sales in this article were calculated using the monthly unaudited sales figures released by Lightstone Auto and the Department of Trade and Industry.
