The City of Cape Town and Sanral on Sunday affirmed their willingness to work together after the roads agency lost a court appeal over tolls for the N1 and N2 highways. &quot;The City is willing to partner with Sanral and provide some of the funding for the necessary projects,&quot; said Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille. She said the two parties needed to find &quot;alternative solutions to road infrastructure projects&quot; such as those on the highways in question. Sanral said in a separate statement that it would abide by Friday&rsquo;s judgment of the Constitutional Court which dismissed their application for leave to appeal a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling that set aside their right to toll the relevant highways. The agency said that it would now &quot;continue to engage the City of Cape Town to find a solution to the growing congestion crisis in the Winelands area&quot;. Sanral spokesperson Vusi Mona said that discussions were already underway. In September 2015, the Western Cape High Court reviewed and set aside approvals that would enable Sanral to go ahead with tolling on those highways in the Winelands district.
