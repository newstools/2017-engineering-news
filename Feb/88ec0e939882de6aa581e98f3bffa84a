Absolute debt levels of countries continue to increase and total outstanding global sovereign commercial debt stock will rise to reach an all-time high of $44-trillion by the end of this year, according to rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s (S&amp;P). In a report entitled Sovereign Debt 2017, S&amp;P expects that the United States and Japan will be the &ldquo;most prolific borrowers&quot; in 2017, accounting for 60% of total borrowing, followed by China, Italy and France. S&amp;P projects that the 130 countries it rates will borrow an equivalent of R6.8-trillion from long-term commercial sources in 2017, which represents a 4% decrease in long-term commercial debt issuance. Net borrowing as a share of countries&rsquo; gross domestic product has been decreasing gradually from 3.3% in 2014, as governments extend their debt maturity profiles in a low interest rate environment and as a result of gradual improvements in fiscal consolidation in several countries. According to S&amp;P&rsquo;s calculations, Japan will face by far the highest debt rollover ratio (including short-term debt) in 2017, reaching 66% of GDP. Japan currently has the highest general government debt ratio among all the countries rated by S&amp;P at 254% of GDP in 2016. EMERGING MARKETS S&amp;P forecasts that gross borrowing from commercial sources in 2017 will increase to $1.07-trillion in 20 major emerging market countries. China is the biggest emerging market borrower with more than a third of the total borrowings, followed by Brazil and India. Emerging markets&rsquo; total commercial debt stock will continue to go up. By year-end 2017, S&amp;P projects that total commercial sovereign debt stock will have risen to $7-trillion, up by $648-billion from December 2016. According to its calculations, Egypt will again face the highest debt rollover ratio (including short-term debt), reaching 29% of GDP. The country has an &ldquo;unusual dependence&rdquo; on short-term debt, which accounts for 34% of total debt. S&amp;P expects China&#39;s gross commercial borrowing to rise compared to 2016, both in absolute terms &ndash; by $25-billion &ndash; and as a share of the sample total (from 31% in 2016 and 33% in 2015). &quot;We forecast Brazil and India to borrow amounts equivalent to $191-billion and $112-billion, respectively. China, Brazil and India will borrow 63% of the 20 emerging market sovereigns,&quot; S&amp;P said in its report. South Africa&rsquo;s net debt to GDP is expected to increase to 48% in 2017, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said in his 2017 Budget Review.
