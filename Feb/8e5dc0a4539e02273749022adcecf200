The Department of Energy (DoE) has extended the public comment period for the new post-2015 National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which was gazetted on December 23, to February 28. The comment period had been due to close on January 22, but owing to the holiday period over December and early January, the DoE has extended the deadline.
