South Africa&#39;s manufacturing and mining output fell in December, data showed on Thursday, but a recovery is expected this year as business confidence picks up and commodity prices rise. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy is struggling to attract investment, with sentiment dimmed by political uncertainty, weak growth that has hit consumer activity, as well as the looming threat of credit downgrades to junk. Manufacturing output fell by 2% year-on-year in December after expanding by 2% in November, Statistics South Africa said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing volumes would remain steady at 0.0% year-on-year in December. On a month-on-month basis, factory production rose 0.3% and edged down 1.1% in the three months to December compared with the previous three months. &quot;There are signs that the manufacturing sector may have strengthened a little at the start of this year,&quot; Capital Economics Senior Emerging Markets Economist William Jackson wrote in a note. &quot;While the relationship between the manufacturing PMI and the output data has broken down a bit in the past couple of years, the improvement in January&rsquo;s PMI does point to faster growth. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry&rsquo;s measure of business confidence tells a similar story.&quot; Activity in South Africa&#39;s private sector remained in growth territory in January, while business confidence rose in the first month of the year, data has shown. Mining output fell 1.9% year-on-year in December after falling 4.5% the prior month, Stats SA said. &quot;Despite the still weak December mining production figures, the performance of mining production should be supported by the forecasted lift in commodity prices in 2017,&quot; Nedbank said in a note.
