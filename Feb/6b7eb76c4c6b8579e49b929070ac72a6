Sicelo Xulu, the MD of City Power, has taken leave to allow for the completion of a forensic investigation into fraud and corruption. The announcement was made on Thursday in a statement issued by City Power, the Johannesburg municipal entity that supplies Johannesburg with electricity. &ldquo;City Power Managing Director, Sicelo Xulu, has offered to take leave with immediate effect pending the finalisation of the forensic investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption at City Power. The Board of City Power has approved the request by Xulu, to take leave pending the finalization of the forensic investigation into corruption,&rdquo; the statement read. Although the board accepted Xulu&rsquo;s offer of leave, it said that it did not believe that suspending Xulu was necessary. &ldquo;Xulu&rsquo;s decision to take leave is informed by a desire to defuse any perceived tension between the City Power Board and its shareholder, the City of Johannesburg,&rdquo; the statement read, adding that the board and Xulu were committed to cooperating with the investigation. Xulu faces allegations of corruption related to the city&rsquo;s R1-billion smart meter tender that was awarded to Edison Power, which is owned by businessman Vivian Reddy.
