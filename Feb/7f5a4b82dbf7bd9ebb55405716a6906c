Iron-ore and steel futures in China jumped more than 4% on Monday, resuming their rally, amid planned curbs in steel production in key areas and a pickup in seasonal demand. Rebar prices pushed to a fresh three-year high and iron-ore neared a record peak, as both commodities benefited from China&#39;s efforts to tackle a steel glut and boost infrastructure spending. The most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 4.7% at 3 610 yuan ($525) a tonne at 0320 GMT after rising as far as 3 648 yuan earlier, its strongest since February 2014. The construction steel product has gained about 24% this year. iron-ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was up 4.4% at 722.50 yuan per tonne. The steelmaking raw material has risen 30% this year, having touched a record high of 741.50 yuan last week. Steel producers in the Hebei-Beijing-Tianjin area have been asked to shift their peak-load production to reduce pollution ahead of the start of China&#39;s National People&#39;s Congress on Friday, said Helen Lau, analyst at Argonaut Securities. Steel inventory held by Chinese traders fell to 16.29-million tonnes as of Feb. 24 from 16.39 million tonnes in the prior week, the first decline since last November, due to seasonal demand recovery, she said. &quot;Looking ahead over short and mid-term, China&#39;s steel market will remain tight on the back of production regulation and seasonal demand recovery. We expect to see more upside in steel prices in both spot and futures markets,&quot; Lau said in a note. The revival in futures could push spot iron-ore prices back toward $100/t, after retreating last week as some traders cast doubt on the sustainability of this year&#39;s rally amid ample stocks of the raw material in China. Iron-ore for delivery to China&#39;s Qingdao port .IO62-CNO=MB slipped 0.9% to $90.50 a tonne on Friday, according to Metal Bulletin. The spot benchmark hit a 30-month peak of $94.86 last Tuesday. Stockpiles of imported iron-ore at 46 major Chinese ports continued to rise, hitting 129.35 million tonnes, the highest since 2004 when SteelHome consultancy began tracking the data.
