Nigeria&#39;s gross domestic product fell by 1.5% in 2016 due to lower oil revenues, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday, for its first annual contraction in 25 years. Africa&#39;s largest economy slid into recession in the second quarter of 2016 as a slump in crude prices hammered the Opec member&#39;s public finances. Crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 1.3%, the statistics office said. The oil sector declined by 12.38% year-on-year in the quarter. &quot;This contraction reflects a difficult year for Nigeria, which included weaker inflation-induced consumption demand, an increase in pipeline vandalism, significantly reduced foreign reserves and a concomitantly weaker currency,&quot; the office said in a report. Oil production &ndash; Nigeria&#39;s economic mainstay &ndash; fell to 1.83-million barrels a day last year after 2.13-million barrels a day in 2015, it added, blaming militant attacks in the Niger Delta oil hub. The non-oil sector fell only by 0.33% in the fourth quarter, the office said. &quot;The very shallow contraction in nonoil GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, raises hope of a more meaningful recovery in nonoil GDP in the first quarter of this year, buoyed both by improved budget spending and some improvement in FX availability,&quot; said Razia Khan, chief economist Africa at Standard Chartered Bank.
