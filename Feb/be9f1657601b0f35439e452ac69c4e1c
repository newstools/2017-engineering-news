The National Employers Association of South Africa (Neasa) on Tuesday requested that steel producer ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) withdraw its plea to the downstream steel industry to join it in a united lobbying effort for higher levels of tariff protection on both primary and value-added steel products. Neasa CEO Gerhard Papenfus said the downstream steel industry does not support any of the protectionist measures AMSA has in mind. &ldquo;If AMSA wants to engage with the downstream [industry] on this issue, it should start by entering into discussions with Neasa . . . the largest representative organisation of downstream steel manufacturers.&rdquo; He said Neasa has already obtained the support of over 2 000 companies that are against both the 10% customs duty, as well as the 30% safeguard duty, AMSA is seeking. &ldquo;If AMSA&#39;s new strategy is one of canvassing support for its downstream-hostile protectionist agenda, Neasa is ready to further mobilise the downstream steel industry.&rdquo; Papenfus noted that many downstream products are already protected at the bound-rate, which is the maximum protection allowed by the World Trade Organisation, to which South Africa is a signatory. He added that protecting the downstream industry was administratively impossible, given the thousands of products produced by the industry.
