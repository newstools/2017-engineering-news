Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has urged South Africans to share their views on economic conditions and to highlight issues they would like government to focus on in the National Budget Speech on February 22. The National Budget Speech will be presented against the backdrop of sluggish economic growth, the looming threat of a possible negative view by independent rating agencies, the fees must fall campaign, as well as uncertainty in global economic conditions. National Treasury says Gordhan would like the public to&nbsp; express its views on the funding of free education for students in tertiary institutions; how South Africa could achieve inclusive economic growth; how the country could use its resources to ensure efficiencies; and how the government, civil society, unions and business could work together to achieve the economic objectives of the country. Contributions can be sent to National Treasury&rsquo;s Facebook page; tweeted to @TreasuryRSA with the #BUDGET2017; submitted via the National Treasury website; or submissions can be made through arranged oral presentations with the department.
