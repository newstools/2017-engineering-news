The Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) had a record year last year, in terms of the numbers of passengers who passed through its airports. This was revealed on Tuesday when it published its latest &#39;Aviation Barometer&#39; report. This is the fourth edition of the report, which is compiled from official ACSA statistics. The number of passengers that used its nine airports last year came to 39.7-million, an increase of 5.4% over the figure for 2015. The company&rsquo;s three major airports all hit new levels of usage. King Shaka International Airport, serving Durban, saw the greatest increase, at 8.45% over 2015, exceeding five-million passengers last year.
