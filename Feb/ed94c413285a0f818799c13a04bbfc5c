Trade union Solidarity has set its sights on the expansion and sustainability of South Africa&rsquo;s domestic steel industry for the year ahead and will soon launch a Support Our Steel (SOS) campaign. The domestic steel industry had suffered significant setbacks in recent times, particularly after the closure of Highveld Steel last year. &ldquo;Solidarity regards the steel industry as a matter of great importance and we want to ensure job retention in the industry for the sake of our members and of all other employees in the industry,&rdquo; said Solidarity deputy general secretary Marius Croucamp. He added that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s allocation of R95-million towards a steel development fund in the coming year was also encouraging. Solidarity&rsquo;s SOS campaign aims to create awareness and achieve purposeful intervention in industry. &ldquo;We must now pull out all the stops to make the domestic steel industry a strong industry in South Africa again. Recent financial support and instructions regarding the use of local steel by government institutions already represent steps in the right direction. &ldquo;Through its SOS campaign and the watchdog role it takes on readily, Solidarity will ensure that such steps are indeed taken,&rdquo; Croucamp explained.
