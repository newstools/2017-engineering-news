Italian energy group Enel&rsquo;s renewable-energy subsidiary Enel Green Power RSA has brought its 82.5 MW apiece Adams and Pulida solar photovoltaic (PV) plants into commercial operation. The Pulida PV plant, in the Northern Cape, and the Adams PV facility, in the Free State, which are supported by 20-year power supply agreements with State-owned power utility Eskom, formed part of the third round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. &ldquo;Enel Green Power RSA&rsquo;s two new solar projects were completed ahead of schedule, according to the highest levels of quality and safety and in full alignment with our commitment to the country&rsquo;s social and economic development,&rdquo; said Enel&#39;s country manager in South Africa, William Price. The Adams and Pulida plants are able to generate an aggregate 318 GWh/y and avoid the emission of more than 290 000 t/y of carbon dioxide.
