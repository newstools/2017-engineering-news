The World Bank expects Democratic Republic of Congo&#39;s economy to average five% growth in 2017/18, compared with 2.7% in 2016, thanks to stronger commodity prices and expanding agriculture and services sectors, it said in a report. Congo, Africa&#39;s top copper producer, has seen its economy battered by low commodity prices over the past two years, with its franc currency losing nearly 40% of its value last year.
