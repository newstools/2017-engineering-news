JSE-listed Bid Corporation (Bidcorp), the food services unit that was unbundled from international services, trading and distribution firm Bidvest last year, delivered a distribution of 250c a share for the six months to December 31. The reported financials show &ldquo;very pleasing&rdquo; results for the first half of the year under review in relation to the comparable half-year, largely on account of Bidcorp&#39;s unbundling from Bidvest in May 2016 and subsequent JSE listing. During the six months under review, basic earnings and headline earnings a share increased by 20.7% and 20.3% respectively to 600.3c apiece. Bidcorp&rsquo;s trading profit increased by 15.7% to R2.8-billion during the first half of the financial year and the trading margin improved from 2.6% in the corresponding six months the year before to 4.2% in the six months to December 2016, owing to an operational focus on growing independent trade and rebalancing the customer portfolio. The gross profit percentage also ticked up to 21.4%, reflecting the benefit of focusing on the correct mix of business. The group&rsquo;s overall half-year net revenue of R67.8-billion, a contraction on the R68.2-billion reported in the pro forma corresponding prior period, was impacted by the ongoing &ldquo;deliberate and planned exit&rdquo; of some large contract businesses in various geographies. &ldquo;Bidcorp&#39;s businesses continue to perform well across all geographies, driven by good organic growth in home currencies and benefiting from market share gains,&rdquo; the company said in the financial update to shareholders. In addition, a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions, totalling R495.8-million, were concluded in Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Italy and the UK, with Bidcorp now keeping a firm eye on opportunities through further bolt-on acquisitions to expand geographic reach and product range extension, complemented by organic growth through a focus on the appropriate business mix. &ldquo;Our financial position is strong, cash generation is expected to remain robust, and we retain significant headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic,&rdquo; the company said, adding that larger acquisitions could be considered to unlock entry into new markets. &ldquo;Bidcorp&#39;s focus remains on realising the potential that exists in its current foodservice operations, as well as acquisitive growth opportunities.&rdquo; In line with this, Bidcorp kicked off a global rebranding exercise, trading as &lsquo;Bidfood&rsquo;, to reinforce its image as &quot;value-add food people&rdquo;. &ldquo;Our foodservice businesses worldwide are executing on the strategy of rebalancing the exposure between contract, national and independent customers in their respective markets. We see our future as a foodservice provider, as opposed to a logistics operator,&rdquo; Bidcorp concluded.
