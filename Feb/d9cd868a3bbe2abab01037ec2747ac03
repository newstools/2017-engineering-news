The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has embarked on the R113.5-million rehabilitation, reconstruction and repair of six bridges across the city, following heavy rainfall and flash flooding in early January. The affected bridges include Belgrave, Joe Nhlanhla, Cork Avenue, Bridge Road, Spring Road and 432 Modderfontein Road, with the JRA advising motorists and pedestrians to use alternative routes with the closing of the Joe Nhlanhla and Bridge Road bridges over the Jukskei river. Construction on the bridges is set to start in July, with the exception of Cork Avenue bridge where the R15-million construction is already under way, as it was completely destroyed. The rehabilitation of the bridge on 432 Modderfontein road, between Lombardy and Lyndhurst, is set to cost R10-million, while the reconstruction of the Spring Road bridge, which will be demolished, is estimated at around R15-million. The Joe Nhlanhla bridge, in Alexandra township, will cost R10-million to rehabilitate and the Bridge Road bridge remedial intervention will cost around R60-million.
