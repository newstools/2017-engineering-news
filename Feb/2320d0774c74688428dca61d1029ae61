The domestic aviation industry continues to have surplus capacity, resulting in occupancy levels that remain low by international standards, says JSE-listed Comair. The company, nevertheless, grew its revenue by 6% for the six months to December 31, as a result of a recovery in yields, but without any increase in volumes. &ldquo;Costs remained flat, with local inflationary pressure being offset by the improved exchange rate applicable to foreign currency-based expenses,&rdquo; it said in a statement on Tuesday.&nbsp; During the period, Comair took delivery of one new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and one leased Boeing 737-800 aircraft to replace its Boeing 737-400 aircraft as part of its fleet replacement programme.&nbsp; Comair achieved an after-tax profit of R199-million and earnings a share and headline earnings a share of 42.8c. Cash generated from operations remained healthy at R448-million, resulting in cash on hand of R949-million as at December 31. PROSPECTS Weak economic growth is expected to maintain pressure on consumer spending and Comair foresees continued pressure on margins in the aviation industry. &ldquo;Comair is, however, well placed to operate in these conditions, with strong brands, committed staff, effective equipment, an efficient cost base and strong cash reserves,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Comair anticipates that the exchange rate will remain volatile and that the price of oil will continue on an upward trend. &ldquo;The ongoing upgrades to our fleet provide mitigation to the expected increase in the fuel price, while also providing an improved customer experience. &ldquo;The new fleet, along with improved technology-driven operating processes, will ensure that we maintain a healthy competitive advantage for the benefit of our customers. &ldquo;Our travel business, flight training facility, catering business and airport lounges are opportunities for further growth,&rdquo; it said. &nbsp;
