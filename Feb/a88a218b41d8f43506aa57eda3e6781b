Wage negotiations between two transport unions and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) have deadlocked, the United National Transport Union (UNTU) said on Thursday. The union said it was demanding a 20% salary increase, while the employer was offering 3%. &ldquo;Management kept on insisting that labour should withdraw its salary demand and table a so-called inflation related increase. We believe that its demand is realistic and fair, given the fact that the cost of living has increased drastically for workers over the past financial year,&rdquo; said UNTU secretary Steve Harris. &ldquo;It seems that the multi-year wage agreement in PRASA, as negotiated by its former CEO, Lucky Montana, has spoiled management. They no longer know how to negotiate in good faith. Labour cannot negotiate with an unwilling partner that has no mandate to improve its offer, despite the R16.7-billion awarded to PRASA in the budget for the next financial year.&rdquo; The unions were ready to declare a dispute on wage negotiations and refer the matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for conciliation. The UNTU is the majority union at PRASA. The other union is the Cosatu-affiliate, the SA Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu). PRASA is responsible for passenger rail services in South Africa.
