State-owned power utility Eskom has terminated six coal transportation agreements under its Free Carrier Arrangement (FCA) following a secondary independent investigation into the unlawful introduction of additional trucks by some FCA transporters. Eskom, which had 58 FCA transporters contracted under a four-year agreement ending March 2018, initiated a &ldquo;limited investigation&rdquo; following a tip-off in July 2016. This initial investigation led to a seven-week suspension, between July 14 and September 7, 2016, of six FCA transporters, with discrepancies within the initial findings triggering the commissioning of a full investigation. &ldquo;It has since emerged during the course of the secondary investigation that the conduct of the six transporters has severely prejudiced compliant FCA transporters to a fair and equitable distribution of coal that was available to be hauled to Eskom&rsquo;s power stations,&rdquo; Eskom interim group CEO Matshela Koko said in a statement on Monday. Some 40-million tonnes of coal is transported either through the FCA transporters contracted directly to Eskom or transporters directly contracted to a mine through a model dubbed &ldquo;Delivered&rdquo; or &ldquo;DEL&rdquo; within Eskom. The six companies that have had their contracts terminated are Constructability 10CC, Fastrak, IM Monokoane, NJM Transport, Lamavuso and Dhlams &amp; Dhlams.
