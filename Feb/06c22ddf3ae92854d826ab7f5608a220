The Department of Public Works (DPW) has appointed a team to prepare a remedial plan for the faulty pump station at the Bluff Naval base, in Durban, following an incident last week in which six people died. The deceased, three contract workers and three South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members, were overcome by gases emanating from the sewerage facility while conducting work there. Two of the workers, Phelelani Zondi and Thokozani Makhoba were employed by a service provider of the DPW. Another was an independent contractor working nearby. The SANDF members died while trying to rescue the distressed workers. In terms of the contract, the water, solid waste and pump specialist contractor is required to test the quality of air near the facility and repair the pump. In accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the plans should be approved by a qualified engineer. The appointment of the specialist company comes after the Department of Labour issued a prohibition notice. Presently, the site remains cordoned off as it has been declared a crime scene. The KwaZulu-Natal Contractors Forum has donated R50 000 which will be split between the Makhoba and Zondi families. The two workers will both be buried on Saturday, in Nkandla and Greytown respectively.
