As part of its ongoing campaign to recover outstanding debt from certain municipalities, State-owned Eskom will on Thursday interrupt electricity supply to the eMalahleni and Msukaligwa municipalities, in Mpumalanga. The power cuts will affect the Doornpoort, Churchill, Kwa-Guqa, Witbank and Ermelo areas. The interruption of supply as a result of nonpayment remains an &ldquo;agonising&rdquo; decision and is a means of last resort, Eskom stated. &ldquo;We take solace in the fact that we spared no effort to collect outstanding debts amicably,&rdquo; it said.
