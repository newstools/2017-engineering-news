South African retailer Massmart reported an almost 16% rise in full-year profit on Thursday, as the firm controlled costs and closed some of its less profitable stores in a tough economic environment. Massmart, majority-owned by Wal-Mart Stores, posted diluted headline earnings per share of 587.6 cents for the 12 months to end-December, compared with 508.8 cents a year earlier. Africa&#39;s most advanced economy accounts for more than 90% of the firm&#39;s sales, but spending by South African consumers has been constrained by inflation, rising debt levels and an unemployment rate of more than 25%. Food and liquor sales increased by 11.7%, outpacing general merchandise sales growth of 1.5%, Massmart said. &quot;It is clear that general merchandise continues to be negatively impacted by very low discretionary spending by consumers,&quot; the company said. Massmart increased its total retail space by 1.2% over the period, but closed 10 of its more than 400 stores. &quot;We are hopeful that several key economic drivers in South Africa will improve in 2017 - lower food price inflation, some rand strength and possibly lower interest rates,&quot; chief executive Guy Hayward said in a statement. Headline EPS is the main profit measure in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items.
