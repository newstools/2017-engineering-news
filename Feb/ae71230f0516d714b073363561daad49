Japan&#39;s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems said on Tuesday it and two other firms had won an power generation plant order including two 70 megawatt turbines from Kenya Electricity Generating Company. Last year, KenGen said it expected to start the construction of the 140 MW plant, known as Olkaria V, in July 2016, with the aim of connecting the geothermal power plant to the grid by the end of 2018. Olkaria is in Kenya&#39;s Rift Valley. &quot;Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, together with Mitsubishi Corporation and H. Young &amp; Company (East Africa), have received a full-turnkey order to provide power generation facilities to ... KenGen, including two sets of 70 MW class steam turbines, generators and auxiliaries,&quot; it said in a statement on its website. KenGen aims to add 720 MW of electricity generating capacity between now and 2020 at a cost of just over $2-billion, with most of the energy coming from geothermal sources. Kenya and Japan said last year Olkaria V was being financed by a 46-billion yen ($410-million) loan.
