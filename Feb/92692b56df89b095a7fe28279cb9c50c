Branded tissue products manufacturer Twinsaver Group is in talks to acquire hygienic disposable products company Validus Medical, further diversifying its portfolio in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. Twinsaver Group CEO Garth Towell said the acquisition would enable the company to service new consumer segments and accelerate Validus&rsquo;s growth through investments in technology, talent and access to wider networks. Established in 2005, Validus has quickly grown its national portfolio of quality, disposable medical products across South Africa&rsquo;s hospital, frailcare and babycare industries. Known for brands like Clemens and Bumbies, the sale will provide Validus with the capital required to expand into ancillary and new categories. Validus MD Folkmar Geyer added that the company&rsquo;s products would complement Twinsaver&rsquo;s products. &ldquo;The added advantage is that the sale will help increase Validus&rsquo;s production efficiencies . . . and help bolster the output of South Africa&rsquo;s manufacturing industry.&rdquo; The sale is subject to regulatory and Competition Commission approval.
