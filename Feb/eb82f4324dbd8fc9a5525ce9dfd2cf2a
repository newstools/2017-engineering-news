JSE-listed Blue Label expects to report a surge in earnings bolstered in part by 58.18%-owned subsidiary Oxigen Services India&rsquo;s fair value gains of R150-million in the six months ended November 30, 2016. Earnings a share are expected to increase by 54% to 58% to between 80.79c and 82.89c for the six months under review. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to come in 52% to 56% higher at between 80.86c and 83.09c and core HEPS some 50% to 55% higher at between 81.90c and 84.63c for the half-year under review. &ldquo;The investment in Oxigen was initially of a long-term nature, as it was expected to emulate the business model of the South African distribution operations. &ldquo;However, its profile has changed from that of the traditional group business to one of generating growth in the market value of the investment with a view to unlocking the group&rsquo;s share thereof,&rdquo; Blue Label said in a trading update to shareholders on Friday. Oxigen is now viewed as a venture capital investment with a fair value gain, less deferred taxation and the group&rsquo;s share of losses in Oxigen for the period under review, equating to a net increase of R135-million to Blue Label&rsquo;s half-year earnings. While the change in focus to financial services means that the unit is unlikely to generate profitability in the short to medium term, the company&#39;s market value is expected to increase exponentially in conjunction with its growth in wallet subscribers. &ldquo;This, in turn, creates the potential to unlock the investment value in the future and the group is pursuing this new strategy with respect to its investment in Oxigen,&rdquo; Blue Label pointed out. Excluding the reported net increase, core HEPS would have ranged between 62.25c and 63.34c apiece, equating to a growth of between 14% and 16%, mostly attributed to organic growth.
