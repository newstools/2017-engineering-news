A senior Transnet executive has been put on special leave following a News24 report on a R10-million tender the State-owned company awarded to the executive&#39;s former boss. Transnet confirmed on Wednesday that Sandile Simelane, the head of Transnet Freight Rail&#39;s (TFR) corporate affairs department, was placed on special leave pending an investigation into the tender in question. Earlier this month, News24 revealed that TFR had awarded a R10-million tender to a company owned by Simelane&#39;s former boss at the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). Transnet insiders have alleged that Simelane played a key role in helping his former boss&#39;s company secure the lucrative contract. The company, Casterbridge Consulting, was paid R400 000 a month over a period of two years for &quot;stakeholder management services&quot; related to Transnet&#39;s Swaziland Rail Link project. The company has no business premises or website and it apparently communicated with Transnet using a Gmail account. When pressed for proof of the work Casterbridge Consulting did for TFR, neither Transnet nor the company&#39;s owner, Sandile Madolo, could provide any material. A Transnet insider claimed that Casterbridge was paid R400 000 each month, regardless of whether it had done any work or not. &quot;Transnet has instituted an investigation relating to a contract that was awarded for the provision of stakeholder management services for the Swazi Rail project,&quot; said Mike Asefovitz, a TFR spokesperson. &quot;Mr Sandile Simelane has been put on special leave to allow for the process to take its course,&quot; added Asefovitz.
