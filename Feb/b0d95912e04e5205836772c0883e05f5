Eskom and Transnet need to borrow billions more than anticipated in 2016, National Treasury revealed in its 2017 Budget Review on Wednesday. Even as Eskom&rsquo;s financial performance improved in 2015/16 as a result of a 12.7% tariff hike and a revenue increase by R10.5-billion to R161-billion, it still required borrowings for its new build and electrification projects. In addition, Transnet grew revenues by 1.7% to R62.2-billion in 2015/16. While it has spent R122.4-billion on capital expenditure in the last five years, it plans capital investments of R273-billion in the next seven years, Treasury said. These massive expenditure projects mean the entities take up the biggest share of government&rsquo;s borrowings. &ldquo;In 2016/17 it (borrowing) will amount to R254.4-billion, or 5.8% of GDP,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;This is R32.8-billion more than was projected in the 2016 Budget, reflecting a larger consolidated budget deficit and higher borrowing estimates by State-owned companies &ndash; primarily Eskom and Transnet.&rdquo; In 2015/16, borrowing by the six largest State-owned companies &ndash; the Airports Company of South Africa, Eskom, Sanral, SAA, the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority and Transnet &ndash; reached R128-billion. Eskom and Transnet accounted for 74% of the total, Treasury explained. Eskom increased planned borrowings in 2016/17 increased from R46.8-billion to R68.5-billion. &ldquo;The increase results from Eskom&rsquo;s revised assumptions of cost savings and lower-than anticipated tariffs during the current price determination period,&rdquo; it said. Over the next seven years, Transnet plans capital investments of R273-billion, to be funded by earnings and borrowings against its balance sheet, it said. Foreign debt funding was lower than estimated, reaching R29.5-billion compared with an expected R42.6-billion. &ldquo;The six companies project aggregate borrowing of R102.6-billion in 2016/17 and R307.1-billion between 2017/18 and 2019/20. &ldquo;Gross foreign borrowings are expected to account for the majority of total funding over the medium term, largely as a result of Eskom&rsquo;s efforts to obtain more developmental funding from multilateral lenders.&rdquo; In 2016, Eskom concluded a deal with the China Development Bank to get a $500-million loan facility. However, Eskom is likely to need additional equity injections in the coming three to four years, according to Nomura emerging market economist Peter Montalto. &ldquo;Its last equity injections stabilised ratios at very low levels, but are still a constraint,&rdquo; he said in December. &ldquo;Nuclear generation would severely leverage Eskom&rsquo;s balance sheet without additional equity injections.&rdquo; Referring to the &ldquo;injection&rdquo;, Treasury said the R23-billion equity injection and the conversion of the R60-billion subordinated loan to equity helped shored up Eskom&rsquo;s balance sheet. &ldquo;State-owned companies are responsible for much of the infrastructure on which the economy relies,&rdquo; Treasury said. &ldquo;Eskom, Transnet and &hellip; Sanral account for about 42% of public-sector capital formation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Over the past year, Eskom continued its capital investment programme &ndash; bringing new generating capacity to the electricity grid &ndash; and maintained steady power supply. Transnet continued to invest in getting more freight from road to rail.&rdquo; Meanwhile, contingent liability exposure to independent power producers (IPPs) is expected to decrease in 2019/20. &ldquo;Government has committed to procure up to R200-billion in renewable energy from IPPs,&rdquo; Treasury said. &ldquo;As at March 2017, exposure to IPPs &ndash; which represents the value of signed projects &ndash; is expected to amount to R125.8-billion. Exposure is expected to decline to R104.1 billion in 2019/20.&rdquo; Government began to categorise power-purchase agreements between Eskom and IPPs as contingent liabilities in 2016. &ldquo;These liabilities can materialise in two ways. If Eskom runs short of cash and is unable to buy power as stipulated in the power-purchase agreement, government will have to loan the utility money to honour its obligations. &ldquo;If government terminates power-purchase agreements because it is unable to fund Eskom, or there is a change in legislation or policy, government would also be liable. Both outcomes are unlikely.&rdquo; It said Eskom is expected to use R43.6-billion of its guarantee in 2016/17 and R22-billion annually over the medium term. It said SAA has used R3.5-billion of a R4.7-billion going-concern guarantee, with the remainder likely to be used in 2017/18.
