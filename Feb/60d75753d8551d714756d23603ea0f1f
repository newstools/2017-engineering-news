ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) narrowed full-year losses by 82%, it said on Friday, citing higher steel prices and a reduction in one-off items. The affiliate of ArcelorMittal, the world&#39;s biggest steelmaker, reported a basic headline loss per share of 244c for the year end December 31, against 1 336c in the previous year. The company said that average steel prices rose 8% but gains were capped by lower consumption amid subdued economic growth and continuing competition from imports. South Africa, which has the only primary steel mill in sub-Saharan Africa, imposed a 10% import tariff in 2015 to protect an industry hurt by cheaper Chinese imports. &quot;The building and construction sector, which typically accounts for almost two thirds of all steel consumption, registered a lacklustre growth rate,&quot; the company said in a statement. Domestic steel demand is expected to remain subdued in 2017, the company said, adding that volatility in the rand/US dollar exchange rate would also weigh on results. Shares in ArcelorMittal South Africa were up 1% at 13.80 rand at 0742 GMT.
