German steelmaker Salzgitter said it would focus on growth and innovation after years of restructuring as market conditions improved to their best since 2012. Salzgitter forecast that pretax profit could as much as triple to between &euro;100-million and &euro;150-million ($106-million and $159-million) this year thanks to rising prices supported by anti-dumping tariffs in Europe as well efficiency measures. &quot;After the unavoidable focus on restructuring and cost cutting initiatives in recent years, we now place special emphasis on innovation and growth,&quot; Chief Executive Heinz Joerg Fuhrmann said in a statement on Tuesday. Salzgitter forecast an increase in sales to around &euro;9-billion this year from &euro;7.91-billion in 2016. Pretax profit in 2016 jumped to &euro;57-million from just &euro;4-million a year earlier, compared with an average estimate of &euro;45-million in a Reuters poll. Sales were in line with estimates. Salzgitter cautioned that its profit outlook was subject to unforeseeable influences including selling and input prices and exchange rates. A 25-euro change in the margin per tonne was sufficient to cause a variation of more than &euro;300-million in its annual result, it said, given the 12-million tonnes of steel products sold by its various units.
