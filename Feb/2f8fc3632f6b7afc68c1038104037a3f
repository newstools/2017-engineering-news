The Southern African Macadamia Growers&rsquo; Association expects the South African macadamia crop to increase by 10.5% year-on-year to 42 000 t of nut in shell this year. This is compared with the 38 000 t produced in 2016, which was 17% lower than the 46 000 t produced in 2015, as a result of the drought and other weather events, including hail. The main increase in production is expected to come from Mpumalanga, which has the largest area planted to macadamias and which also accounts for 70% of new plantings.
