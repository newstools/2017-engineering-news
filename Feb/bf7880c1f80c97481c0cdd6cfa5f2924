The Competition Tribunal has found that construction company Concor, a subsidiary of Murray and Roberts (M&amp;R), colluded with other construction companies in tenders involving five projects. The projects include the upgrade of the N12 Beefmaster intersection to Bloemhof; the rehabilitation of the Ermelo to Amersfoort route; the upgrade of the national road between Tsitsikamma and Witelbos; the Ngezi Phase 1 civil works project; and a project at Tati Activox in Botswana. &ldquo;The decision followed a complaint lodged by the Competition Commission with the tribunal in which the commission sought a declaratory order from the tribunal confirming that Concor had contravened the Competition Act in relation to the projects,&rdquo; the tribunal said in a statement on Thursday. In 2006, M&amp;R was given conditional immunity from an administrative penalty for the projects, which extends to Concor. Concor had applied for leniency under the commission&rsquo;s Construction Fast-Track Settlement process, which resulted in the commission, in June 2013, fining 15 major construction companies, including M&amp;R, a collective R1.46-billion for collusive tendering on various projects between 2006 and 2011.
