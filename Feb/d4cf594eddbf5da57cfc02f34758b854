More than 15 t of recycled expanded polystyrene have gone into the production of 20 000 of alternative building company Greenlite Concrete&rsquo;s concrete blocks for use in the new Table Bay Mall that is under construction. The 65 000 m&sup2; mall, which is expected to open in September, is located on a 20 ha site on the corner of the R27 and Berkshire Boulevard on the West Coast. Vivid Architects and Group Five Construction specified Greenlite&rsquo;s concrete blocks for use primarily on the fire escape passages, owing to the product&rsquo;s fire rating.&nbsp; &ldquo;Over the past 18 years, we have been involved in the manufacture and installation of alternative building technologies. We were looking for a more environment-friendly way of implementing our insulated building systems when we started experimenting with recycled polystyrene as the basis for our energy efficient walling systems,&rdquo; Greenlite technical adviser Hilton Cowie explained in a statement.&nbsp; The blocks are made from recycled polystyrene which is used as a lightweight aggregate that is mixed with cement and additives to form insulated, soundproof, fireproof, water-resistant and lightweight concrete blocks and screeds. &ldquo;Because these blocks are lightweight, they are easy to move around the site and engineers saved weight loading onto the suspended concrete slabs,&rdquo; Cowie said. He noted that the manufacturing of these blocks has a direct and positive impact on recycling rates by diverting large volumes of post-consumer polystyrene from South Africa&rsquo;s landfills.
