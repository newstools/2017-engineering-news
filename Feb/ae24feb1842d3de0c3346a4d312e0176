Owing to persistently low commodity and energy prices, which significantly impacted on its oil and gas platform, JSE-listed Murray &amp; Roberts (M&amp;R) expects to report a decline in operational earnings for the 2017 financial year. The company on Wednesday said its earnings would further be impacted on by the net present value charge of R170-million associated with the voluntary rebuild programme agreement entered into by listed South African construction companies and government in October 2016. As such, M&amp;R expects to post a 65% to 75% decline in headline earnings, while its basic earnings are expected to fall by 63% to 74%. However, the group remained positive, stating that the natural resource market sectors were cyclical and that the group would trade through this difficult period. &ldquo;We are well positioned for the expected upturn in the commodity cycle in the medium-to-long term,&rdquo; it said.
