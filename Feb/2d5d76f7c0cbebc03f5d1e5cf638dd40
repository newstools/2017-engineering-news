South African paper and packaging company Mondi&#39;s 2016 underlying profit rose, helped by good performance in all its businesses despite pricing pressure in a number of key paper grades. Mondi, which is also listed in London, said underlying operating profit rose 3% to &euro;981-million ($1-billion)in the full-year to end December from &euro;957-million in the previous year. Group revenue was down 2% to &euro;6.6-billion due to the impact of currency movements. &quot;We anticipate a more challenging trading environment in certain uncoated fine paper markets following price erosion in Europe over the course of 2016, combined with emerging market currency volatility,&quot; CE David Hathorn said. The paper and packaging firm declared a dividend of 38.19 euro cents a share. Shares in Johannesburg-listed Mondi were down 1.87% at R294.38 rand.
