Commuters in Johannesburg must once again prepare for further traffic setbacks, as the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) will, from February 16, close one of the four southbound lanes of the double decker bridge. This lane closure, which forms part of the JRA&rsquo;s overall rehabilitation programme for this arterial route, will be effective for three weeks. This is in addition to the two northbound lanes that are already closed for rehabilitation. &ldquo;We apologise for the inconvenience while this essential bridge reconstruction work is being undertaken. Work will reduce future flooding and safeguard the bridge&#39;s structure for many years to come. &ldquo;Motorists are urged to familiarise themselves with the lane reductions during off-peak and peak times, plan their routes in advance to avoid delays and to consider alternative routes,&rdquo; said JRA MD Dr Sean Phillips. The double decker bridge rehabilitation includes structural repairs, rehabilitation and maintenance to bridge beams, asphalt surfacing, expansion joints, drainage systems and the installation of new road signs. To ensure the project reaches completion in the shortest amount of time with minimal impact to motorists, the majority of the repairs are being carried out at night to avoid traffic disruption.
