The Boeing Company has opened two new offices in Africa, one in Johannesburg and another in Nairobi, Kenya. The offices will be managed by Boeing International sub-Saharan Africa MD and Boeing Commercial Airplanes Africa international sales director Miguel Santos, in Johannesburg, and market development and government affairs director Chamsou Andjorin in Nairobi. &ldquo;Africa is not new territory for Boeing. Since the introduction of the jet airplane, Boeing aircraft have formed the backbone of the continent&rsquo;s commercial fleet and Boeing continues to be one of the largest US-based companies doing business on the continent,&rdquo; Santos said. He added that the aerospace industry needed to start paying closer attention to Africa, as the continent was &ldquo;clearly on the move&rdquo; economically and all the trends were pointing in the right direction for the expansion of the sector. &ldquo;Our job is to be ahead in understanding these emerging trends and opportunities,&rdquo; he noted. Indicators show that gross domestic product on the continent will continue to grow by almost 5% a year over the next decade, with Boeing&rsquo;s most recent &#39;Current Market Outlook&#39; report predicting that air traffic to and from Africa is expected to grow by about 6.1% a year over the next 20 years, resulting in the need for 1 150 new airplanes.
