In conjunction with the listing, PFF will undertake a private placement of up to 117-million shares to invited investors at R4.50 apiece. This, the company noted, will raise around R526.5-million. The company believes the listing will provide it with access to capital to grow its business both organically and through future acquisitions.

It has four operating divisions, two companies and an interest in a number of joint venture operations.
