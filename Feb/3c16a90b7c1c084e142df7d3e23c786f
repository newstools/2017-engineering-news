The South African Sugar Association (Sasa) believes there has been insufficient public involvement in discussions on the implementation of the proposed tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday confirmed that the proposed tax, which will be levied at a rate of 2.1c/g of sugar content in excess of 4 g/100 ml, will be implemented later this year, after the relevant legislation is passed. &ldquo;It is inevitable that the imposition of the tax will negatively affect both the milling and sugarcane agricultural sectors of the local sugar industry. Loss in revenue and a reduction in sugar consumption will result in a shrinkage of the industry with accompanying job losses,&rdquo; Sasa chairperson Rolf L&uuml;tge said in a statement. He added that the sugar industry is under siege owing to a devastating drought, inadequate import tariff protection and other external factors. The proposed tax, he noted, will compound matters and threaten the survival and sustainability of the industry. &ldquo;The sugar industry provides about 85 000 direct jobs, which represents over 11% of the total agricultural workforce in South Africa. Indirect employment is estimated at 350 000 jobs. Approximately 1% of South Africa&rsquo;s population depend on the sugar industry for a living,&rdquo; L&uuml;tge said. Sasa contends that sugar is not responsible for obesity, as claimed by government. The statement added that a full assessment of the causes of obesity and noncommunicable diseases, in South Africa, needs to be undertaken, as should a proper socioeconomic impact study to determine the extent of the impact of the proposed tax on affected industries.
