WesBank has announced the appointment of Mark Finlayson as the CEO of its Motor division&nbsp;following the departure of Simphiwe Nghona on February 1. Finlayson is the current CEO of DirectAxis, a subsidiary of WesBank specialising in non-secured personal loans. &ldquo;We are excited about what Mark will bring to our Motor division &ndash; the largest division in the WesBank Group &ndash; in particular his strong business acumen, detailed analytical abilities and notable leadership skills,&rdquo; says WesBank Group CEO Chris de Kock. &ldquo;Mark has been successful in introducing a partnership approach into DirectAxis, which is highly relevant in Motor where a large portion of the business emanates from collaborating with both our [vehicle manufacturer] joint ventures and dealers. &ldquo;When combined with the division&rsquo;s existing strong executive team, we are confident that under his leadership, WesBank Motor will continue to be a formidable competitor in the retail vehicle finance market.&rdquo; Finlayson takes on his new role from March 1. Prior to joining DirectAxis, Finlayson worked for Mweb, an investment bank in the UK, Rabobank International and Richemont International, working in London and Geneva, respectively. &nbsp;
