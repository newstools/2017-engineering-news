South Africa&#39;s Cell C and its creditors have agreed a deal with Blue Label Telecoms and an unnamed investor that would lower the mobile phone firm&#39;s debt to R6-billion ($463-million), Blue Label said in a statement. Cell C is South Africa&#39;s third-0largest mobile phone company but a debt burden of about R20-billion has hampered its growth in a maturing phone market where rivals Vodacom and MTN are much bigger. Blue Label, the largest distributor of prepaid airtime and data in South Africa, agreed last year to pay R5.5-billion for a 45% stake in Cell C and said it would lead the company&#39;s recapitalisation plan. Blue Label said on Monday that its stake in the firm would remain unchanged even though the unnamed investor in the deal to lower Cell C&#39;s debt would be taking 15%. &quot;The third-party investor is to subscribe for 15% of the share capital of Cell C for R2-billion,&quot; Blue Label said. Shares in Blue Label were up 5.6% at R18.80 by 12:31 GMT. &quot;The restructuring agreement addresses the over-geared balance sheet of Cell C and will unlock further improved and exciting performance,&quot; Cell C said in a statement.
