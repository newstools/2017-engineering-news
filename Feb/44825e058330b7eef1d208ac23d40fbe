With 2016 reportedly the hottest year on record, the Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) says the built environment can play a major role in climate change mitigation. Progressively more South African property investors are making positive impacts on the environment and their businesses through green building. &ldquo;The good news is that we can change our behaviour,&rdquo; GBCSA CEO Dorah Modise said in a statement. She added that the property sector knows it has a substantial contribution to make in rapidly reducing emissions. &ldquo;It is taking action by designing, building and operating buildings in ways that are better for the environment.&rdquo; &nbsp; So far, 230 formal green building certifications have been achieved in South Africa. &nbsp; &ldquo;As the GBCSA enters its tenth year, all signs point to green building gaining even greater momentum in the country.&rdquo; &nbsp; The residential sector is demonstrating a rapid uptake in green building, with 3 500 homes registered with the GBCSA targeting certification following the first year of operating the Edge rating tool. Each formal green building certification marks more progress towards climate change mitigation and better environments in South Africa&rsquo;s metros, cities and towns. &nbsp; &ldquo;When we build better, we do better. Green building is a good decision for business, for people and for our planet,&rdquo; said Modise. &nbsp;
