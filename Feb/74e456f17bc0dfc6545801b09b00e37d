China&#39;s Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday it was &quot;seriously concerned&quot; by what it said was Europe&#39;s increasing protectionism in the steel industry after regulators slapped anti-dumping duties on certain types of plate steel imports from the world&#39;s top producer. In a statement the government called on Europe to treat Chinese companies &quot;fairly and impartially&quot; and said it was ready to strengthen communication with the EU to tackle issues in the industry. On Tuesday the European Commission imposed definitive anti-dumping duties ranging between 65.1% and 73.7% on imports of certain heavy plate non-alloy or other alloy steel from China. The final ruling comes after regulators set provisional tariffs in October. The companies named in the ruling included Nanjing Iron &amp; Steel, Minmetals Yingkou Medium Plate, Wuyang Iron and Steel and Wuyang New Heavy &amp; Wide Steel Plate.
