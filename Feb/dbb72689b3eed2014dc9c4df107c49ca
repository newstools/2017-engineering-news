Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the R20 an hour minimum wage agreement is not a living wage. Addressing media at Parliament on Wednesday, Ramaphosa said the agreement was a starting point to lift 6.6-million workers who are earning below R3 500 a month out of poverty and inequality. Ramaphosa and members of the&nbsp; National Economic Development and Labour Council - except Cosatu - signed the agreement on Tuesday. Ramaphosa said it was not &quot;his&quot; agreement that he &quot;sucked out of thin air&quot;, but follows two years of engagement with three labour federations, business leaders and community organisations. &quot;This is an historical development in our country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Finally we have a national minimum wage: a national minimum wage which no doubt won&rsquo;t make everyone happy and excited; a national minimum wage which is going to lift the income levels of no less than 6.6 million workers who currently are bellowing R3 500. &ldquo;Yes, it could have been lifted to any number you choose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But this would have had dire consequences with a huge loss of jobs. &ldquo;It is a balance to provide a platform to improve income levels of our people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me stress: this is not a living wage. This is not meant to be a wage people can live on.&rdquo; Ramaphosa has been widely criticised for the low wage, with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) saying it was not even enough for the deputy president&rsquo;s dog to survive on. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said the amount is a &ldquo;slave wage&rdquo;. However, Ramaphosa said he preferred being criticised for doing something as opposed to not doing anything at all to start the process of combating inequality, unemployment and poverty. &ldquo;We had to start somewhere to create balance and play it safe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are criticised all round for it, but hey, it is better to be criticised having done something instead of being criticised for doing nothing. &ldquo;I have been lambasted and called all sorts of names,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are doing this for 6.6 million lives. It won&rsquo;t be improved by slogans and people standing on podiums saying that lives will be improved.&rdquo; He quelled concerns from labour and business. From a labour perspective, he said, there is a provision which rules that businesses can&rsquo;t change their hours or conditions of employment due to the national minimum wage. From a business perspective, he said businesses can apply to be exempt from the minimum wage.
