South Africa&#39;s Competition Commission has reached an agreement with Citibank for its role in a forex trading cartel, the antitrust watchdog said on Monday. The commission said in a statement Citi would pay a fine of R69.5-million rand ($5-million), less than the 10% of South African annual turnover that it said banks would pay because it &quot;undertook to cooperate with the commission.&quot;
