President Jacob Zuma will, during a pre-State of the Nation (Sona) Business Investor Luncheon, in Cape Town, on Tuesday, call for &ldquo;unity in action&rdquo; to drive South Africa on a sustainable growth path. This will be his second such meeting with business leaders a few days before he delivers the State of the Nation Address. The meeting will serve as a platform to further strengthen cooperation between government, organised labour and business to promote inclusive economic growth, radical socioeconomic transformation and job creation in South Africa. &nbsp; The President will be accompanied by members of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Investment, which he established in 2016 to improve support and assistance to investors wishing to take advantage of vast investment opportunities in South Africa. &nbsp; The IMC on Investment focuses on areas such as easing the regulatory and bureaucratic burden that hinders investment. It also aims to create a climate that attracts and is conducive to investment. &nbsp; The Presidency said in a statement that the initiative stresses the importance that Zuma attaches to close cooperation and unity in action between organised labour, business and government in turning around the economy and creating jobs.&nbsp; Zuma will deliver his Sona address on Thursday. &nbsp;
