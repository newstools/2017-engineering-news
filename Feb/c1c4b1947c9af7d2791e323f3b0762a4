Ten companies have expressed interest in building a major road project from Nairobi into the Rift Valley and managing it for 30 years, Kenya&#39;s Public Private Partnership Unit (PPPU) has said in a statement. The East African nation is seeking more private investment to maintain the pace of spending on highways, railways and other vital assets while reducing the budget deficit. The public&ndash;private partnership model has been touted as a promising route to fund new infrastructure across Africa, a continent that struggles with poor transport networks. But analysts say financing has often stumbled over government guarantees and revenue sharing deals. The statement did not name the interested companies.
