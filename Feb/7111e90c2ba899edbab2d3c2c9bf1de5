Sustainable business models could open up economic opportunities of up to $12-trillion across 60 global hot spots, and contribute to an increase in employment of up to 380-million jobs by 2030, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;Better Business, Better World&rsquo; report states. More than half of the total value of the opportunities are in developing countries. In Africa alone, sustainable business models could open an economic prize of at least $1.1-trillion and create over 85-million new jobs by 2030. One market hot spot &ndash; affordable housing &ndash; could create over 13-million of these jobs, while risk pooling has been identified as the single-largest monetary opportunity in Africa, valued at $150-billion. &ldquo;The world is seeing, increasingly, that African companies are models for what can be achieved with ingenuity and innovation as they solve difficult social challenges. &ldquo;They are not wedded to old solutions, [and for example], in Kenya, we see digital innovators delivering banking, energy and health solutions. The speed of innovation and adoption is astonishing,&rdquo; said Business and Sustainable Development Commission chairperson Mark Malloch-Brown at the launch of the report, in Nairobi. &quot;Africa has a real opportunity to lead the way in doing better business for a better world. As a commission, we have found that, across the continent, there is potential for inclusive, green growth and development which remains untapped,&rdquo; said mobile network operator Safaricom CEO and Business Commission member Bob Collymore. &ldquo;We stand on the cusp of possibilities and we must seize the opportunity now. As the report shows, there has been, in the last few years, a demonstration of the possibility of leapfrogging development through new technologies and the Internet to bring development in transformative ways that also promotes purpose,&rdquo; he added.
