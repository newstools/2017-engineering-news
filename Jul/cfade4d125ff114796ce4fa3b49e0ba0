JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Although the Department of Mineral Resources did not have any consultation with the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Commission before publishing the Reviewed Mining Charter, it did consult with the Department of Trade and Industry on the definition of a black person. This was confirmed by Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies on Thursday in a Parliamentary reply to a question posed by the Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s Dean Macpherson. Davies noted that, according to definitions in the BEE Act 53 as amended by Act 46 &ldquo;black people is a generic term which means Africans, Coloureds and Indians&rdquo; and advised all departments and charter councils to adopt these definitions. He further outlined that, according to the Act, black people are citizens of South Africa by birth or descent, or became citizens by naturalisation before April 27, 1994.
