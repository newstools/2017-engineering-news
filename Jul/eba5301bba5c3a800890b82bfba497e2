Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) COO Ben Theron says electronic tolling (e-tolling) on Gauteng&rsquo;s freeways should be a &ldquo;thing of the past&rdquo; by March next year. Speaking at the FleetX Conference 2017 in Midrand on Thursday, he noted that a test case between Outa and the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) on the collection of e-tolls should head to court in January or February next year. He said Sanral had abandoned a long agreed upon test case, but that Outa would push for a test case by default. Theron said he was positive that the High Court would declare the Gauteng e-tolling system illegal. Should the case progress to the Constitutional Court, he was confident that Outa&rsquo;s arguments were solid enough to secure victory. Driving Outa&rsquo;s case were a number of arguments, including what Theron noted were Sanral&rsquo;s failure to consider funding alternatives to e-tolling; environmental impact assessments on the toll project not being done &ldquo;properly&rdquo;, as well as the fact that there was no integrated public transport system available as an alternative to Gauteng commuters.
