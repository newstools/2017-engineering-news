Former City Power MD Sicelo Xulu, who was relieved from his position by City of Johannesburg (CoJ) Mayor Herman Mashaba this week, refuted media reports that he was corrupt or that there was any corruption within the municipal entity. Mashaba earlier this week said a forensic report tabled in front of City Power&rsquo;s board last week detailed serious misconduct by Xulu, who was placed on special leave in February. Xulu argued that &ldquo;no detail whatsoever&rdquo; was given in recent media reports that could connect him to corrupt activities. &ldquo;City Power [even] informed me that they do not intend to institute disciplinary proceedings against me,&rdquo; said Xulu. However, Mashaba explained that, owing to Xulu&rsquo;s contract expiring at the end of August, CoJ could not complete a disciplinary hearing in time. &ldquo;The enquiry into allegations of alleged corruption made against myself and others was initiated by CoJ in January. &ldquo;Many of these allegations made against me are not new, having been the subject matter of previous investigations and reviews by reputable professional institutions, such as a well-established auditing and forensic firm, a leading law firm, practicing advocates and also by the Auditor-General, all of which concluded that I was not implicated in any impropriety whatsoever,&rdquo; Xulu said in a statement. He added that the CoJ and City Power had no legal basis to suspend him, adding that he has not been provided a copy of the forensic report. &ldquo;I have . . . no knowledge whatsoever of the findings or whether there are, in fact, any allegations of impropriety on my behalf,&rdquo; Xulu said. He has requested a meeting with the City Power board to discuss the allegations. &ldquo;I agree with Mayor Mashaba that corruption must be stamped out and it is for that reason that I am happy to assist City Power to [any] extent.&rdquo; Mashaba further said Xulu could now face criminal charges, with the forensic department compiling a report which will be handed to law enforcement agencies. &ldquo;Millions of rands were paid to a contractor who has not performed the work required. Had City Power&rsquo;s governance and management systems not been eroded by corruption, quality services would have been delivered to the residents of [Johannesburg&#39;s] communities,&rdquo; Mashaba said on Monday.
