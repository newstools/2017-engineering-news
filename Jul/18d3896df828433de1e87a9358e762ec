Germany said it was waiting to see what US President Donald Trump&#39;s delegation had to say on the issue of over capacity in the steel industry at a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies starting in Hamburg on Friday. &quot;I can&#39;t say in advance what the results - or individual results - of this G20 will be,&quot; government spokesperson Steffen Seibert told a regular government news conference on Wednesday. Asked if steel would be an issue, he added: &quot;That will become apparent. It also remains to be seen what the American president brings (to the meeting).&quot; White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said last week Trump would use the premise of a national security review of the US steel industry to demand action by G20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market.
