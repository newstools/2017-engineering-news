South Africa&#39;s troubled state-run airline South African Airways asked the Treasury for a R10-billion ($770-million) bail-out in March, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said in a written reply to parliamentary questions. Gigaba did not say if the request for R10-billion would be granted. The minister said the request had been made in a one-year corporate plan submitted by the airline. The airline was provided state funds in July to help it repay loans of about R2.3-billion to Standard Chartered.
