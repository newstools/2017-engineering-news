The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) on Friday said &ldquo;any way forward&rdquo; on the looming labour strike in the engineering sector would be determined by its members through upcoming meetings. Following Numsa&rsquo;s Central Committee meeting this week, the trade union had resolved to debate and consult on the status of the current negotiations, including the possibility of a strike, through regional shop steward councils and general meetings. &ldquo;The union will convene a national meeting to consider the outcomes of the general meetings, which will determine the way forward about the future of negotiations in the engineering sector. &ldquo;Once we have consulted our members we will inform the press of the way forward,&rdquo; Numsa commented. The Central Committee meeting was attended by the national office bearers, regional office bearers and officials from Numsa&rsquo;s nine regions.
