The City of Cape Town on Monday warned residents to conserve more water as a harsh summer is predicted for the city in 2018. In a statement, the city said residents should use less than 87 l of water per person per day. &quot;Dam levels remain critically low and we must build up our reserves while we still have water,&quot; the statement by the city reads. Storage levels are at 25.3%, up 0.8% from the past week. City-wide consumption was 634-million litres of collective water usage per day on Monday, 134-million above the city&#39;s target of 500-million litres per day. On Monday June 26, city-wide consumption was 630-million litres per day. Mayor Patricia de Lille thanked &quot;water ambassadors&quot; who have gone the extra mile to conserve water. &quot;As for the bad apples who are clearly putting their own needs before the needs of our city, we will be engaging with you and clamping down on unjustifiably high-water use,&quot; she said.
