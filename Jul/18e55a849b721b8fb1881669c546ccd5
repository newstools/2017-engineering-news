South Africa President Jacob Zuma arrived in Hamburg, Germany, on Thursday morning for the Group of 20 (G20) Leaders&rsquo; Summit which is scheduled to take place on July 7 and 8 under the theme &ldquo;Shaping an Interconnected World&rdquo;. South Africa is one of the 19 member countries of the Group of 20 (G20) which, in addition to the European Union (EU), the twentieth member, have been meeting regularly since 1999 to discuss global economic policy coordination. According to a statement from the Presidency, at this year&rsquo;s summit, leaders are scheduled to discuss the world economy, trade and investment, employment, strengthening the international financial architecture, financial markets and international tax cooperation and also focus on climate and energy, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, terrorism and extremism, global health, digital technology, as well as women empowerment. Zuma said South Africa was looking forward to the G20 Summit as it would provide government a platform to engage and interact with the world leaders, particularly against the unfavourable background of slow global economic growth which impacts on South Africa directly as an integral part of the global economy. &ldquo;South Africa&rsquo;s participation will be guided by key pillars which include promoting world peace and a just global economic order, promoting Africa&rsquo;s sustainable development through global partnerships, advocating the transformation of international institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and the United Nations Security Council, promoting cooperation with other developing countries through strengthening South-South cooperation as well as further strengthening cooperation with developed countries through further strengthening the North-South Dialogue in the interest of our country and Africa as a whole,&rdquo; the statement said. The G20, conceptualised to stabilise and strengthen the global economy, brings together the major advanced and emerging market economies, which together represent around 85% of global GDP, 80% of global trade and two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population. Zuma will also participate in a meeting of the BRICS Leaders Meeting which will be held on the margins of the G20 Summit, to be chaired by the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, as the current chair of BRICS. South Africa assumes the chair next year. Zuma is accompanied by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba and the Minister of Energy, Nkhensani Kubayi.
