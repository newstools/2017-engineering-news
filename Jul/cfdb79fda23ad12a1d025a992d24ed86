Gambian Oil Minister Fafa Sanyang confirmed on Wednesday that the West African nation had ended talks to extend the exploration rights of Oslo-listed African Petroleum for two offshore oil blocks. &quot;That&#39;s the truth. You already got the message about the licences,&quot; he said, referring to comments made by permanent secretary for petroleum Mod K. Ceesay that were published by Reuters on Tuesday. African Petroleum, which maintains that it still holds the legal rights to the licences, did not respond to a request for immediate comment on Wednesday.
