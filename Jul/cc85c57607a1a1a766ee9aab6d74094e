China&#39;s Hebei province will slash 11.48-million tonnes in outdated steelmaking capacity to accommodate the expansion of a new plant, part of efforts by the country&#39;s top steel-producing region to rein in surplus production. China, the world&#39;s biggest steel producer, has been shutting outdated steel plants but also keeping any expansion under control to help tackle a years-long glut. Authorities closed more than 600 steel mills producing low-grade construction steel during the first half of the year, cutting capacity by about 120-million tonnes, the state-owned China Economic Daily reported earlier on Tuesday. Last month, China said it has reduced its total steel production capacity by 42.4-million tonnes as of end-May, meeting 85% of its full-year target. In Hebei, the combined reduction in steelmaking capacity at nine mills of more than 11-million tonnes was meant to make way for the expansion of a plant by Shougang Jintang Iron and Steel Co, according to a document published on the Hebei government&#39;s website this week. The expansion at Shougang Jintang Steel&#39;s plant will add new capacity of 5.1-million tonnes, it said. The entire plant, when finished, can produce 9-million tonnes of steel products annually. Shougang Jintang is a unit of Chinese conglomerate Shougang Group. Hebei aims to cut total annual steel production capacity to less than 200-million tonnes by the end of the decade from 286-million tonnes in 2013.
