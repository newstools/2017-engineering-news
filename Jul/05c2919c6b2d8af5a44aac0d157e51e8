German industrial group Thyssenkrupp aims to hold less than half of a steel joint venture it wants to set up with Tata Steel so it can deconsolidate the business from its balance sheet, Handelsblatt reported, citing a company source. Thyssenkrupp and Tata have been in discussions since last year to combine their European operations in a joint venture to remove overcapacity from the market and cut costs, and had so far said to be planning a 50:50 venture. Negotiations for a deal have been hampered by Britain&#39;s vote to leave the European Union and concern over Tata&#39;s pension deficit in Britain. A source close to Thyssenkrupp had said a deal in May to separate Tata&#39;s &pound;15-billion ($19.4-billion) UK pension scheme still left many questions unanswered. Thyssenkrupp&#39;s operations are mainly in Germany, while Tata&#39;s are in Britain and the Netherlands. Handelsblatt said in a summary of an article to be published on Monday that Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger and Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairperson of Tata group&#39;s holding company Tata Sons, are to hold talks this month. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on the report. Tata was not immediately available for comment. Thyssenkrupp&#39;s steel works council chief, Guenter Back, said last month that finance chief Guido Kerkhoff had said the company would decide by the end of the 2016/17 fiscal year, which runs through September, whether to proceed. According to Handelsblatt, many questions remain to be discussed as the two companies had not yet had a chance to look at each others&#39; books.
