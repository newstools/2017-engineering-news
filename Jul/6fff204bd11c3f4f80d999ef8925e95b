JSE-listed real estate investment trust (Reit) Vukile Property Fund has acquired a portfolio of nine newly built retail parks across Spain through its 98.3%-owned Spanish subsidiary Castellana Properties. Castellana will acquire the nine properties from Redevco Iberian Ventures, a joint venture between Ares and Redevco, for R2.8-billion. &nbsp; The deal will increase Vukile&rsquo;s diversification, boost its international exposure to around 21% of total property assets and grow its Spanish portfolio to 11 properties.&nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, CEO Laurence Rapp said the transaction has given Vukile immediate scale in Spain. &ldquo;Vukile now offers the most focused exposure to Spanish property available in the South African Reit market. The acquisition represents a 6.2% pre-geared property yield and reaffirms Vukile&rsquo;s prospects to deliver growth in dividends of between 7% and 8% in its current financial year ending March 31, 2018,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; The nine properties have a total gross lettable area of 117 670 m2 and are geographically diversified across Spain. The portfolio comprises 73 stores of which 95% of gross revenue is derived from Spanish national and international retail tenants including Media Markt, Sprinter, Worten, Aki and Mercadona. The portfolio has a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years to expiry and 4.9 years to the next break option. &nbsp; Rapp pointed out that there were further growth opportunities in the properties&rsquo; rental levels and unharnessed potential in the portfolio that Vukile planned to unlock with its core strength in active asset management. &nbsp; Current managers Redevco will continue to manage the portfolio for a six-month period overlapping with the introduction of an asset management team of Spanish retail property experts that Vukile has built in Spain. &ldquo;This will ensure a smooth handover and transition,&rdquo; said Rapp. &nbsp; To fund the acquisition, Castellana has procured debt funding of &euro;94.8-million from Spanish lenders at an all-in cost of debt of 1.98%. Vukile has funded the remaining &euro;103.3-million using the substantial&nbsp;war chest it has built up for its international expansion. &nbsp; With its increased exposure to international property markets, Vukile has put in place a foreign exchange hedging policy to reduce adverse foreign exchange fluctuations. It will hedge on average 75% of its earnings from its international investments over a three-year period. After the transaction, Vukile&rsquo;s consolidated group gearing level is expected to be at 31.7%. Rapp pointed out that the Spanish economy provided one of the most attractive growth rates in the Eurozone region, with gross domestic product growth of 3.2% in 2016 and 2.2% forecast for 2017, compared with 1.5% for the Eurozone &ndash; an outperformance trend set to continue for the next decade. &nbsp; &ldquo;Spain&rsquo;s retail market indicators are positive and trending in line with the Spanish economic recovery. Retail rental levels remain at pre-financial crisis levels with the constrained supply of retail product driving up demand,&rdquo; he said.
