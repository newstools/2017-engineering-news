South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago defended its independence on Monday in the face of a recommendation by the country&#39;s main anti-graft watchdog agency that the central bank&#39;s mandate should be changed. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set off a political row this month when she called for an overhaul of the bank&#39;s mandate - to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency - rattling investors and hitting the rand hard. The central bank has since filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. On Friday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba echoed criticism of the recommendation by parliament and the ruling party, accusing the agency of overstepping the mark. &quot;The Reserve Bank is respected because the people who are leading the institution are acting according to the constitution. I am acting according to the constitution and I am acting independently, without fear, favour and prejudice,&quot; Kganyago said at a public lecture on monetary policy. &quot;It is then for South Africans to say yes, we respect this institution, and when the institution is under attack, they should be able to say: hands off our Reserve Bank.&quot; South Africa is immersed in political rows over President Jacob Zuma&#39;s leadership, with the 75-year-old facing calls to resign over various scandals. Zuma denies any wrongdoing. The credit rating of Africa&#39;s most industrialised country has been downgraded to &quot;junk&quot; by two of the three biggest rating agencies, the economy has slipped into recession and the unemployment rate is close to 28%, a 14-year high. The row over the central bank&#39;s mandate has raised fears of further economic turmoil. In an editorial in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kganyago said South Africa risked slipping into a long and painful economic recession if the central bank was forced to abandon its policy of reducing inflation and protecting the currency.
