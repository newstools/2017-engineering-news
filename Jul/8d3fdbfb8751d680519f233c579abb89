Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi has appointed Road Accident Fund (RAF) COO Lindelwa Jabavu acting CEO, effective July 1. Jabavu, who will serve in the role until the process to employ a new CEO is finalised, takes over from Dr Eugene Watson, who stepped down from his position in June, when his five-year term ended. &ldquo;This will guarantee that stability is maintained during the ushering in of a new compensation system under the Road Accident Benefit Scheme (RABS), thus ensuring productivity continues,&rdquo; RAF chairperson Dr Ntuthuko Bhengu said. He added that with the Department of Transport&rsquo;s (DoT&rsquo;s) RABS Bill currently before Parliament, the RAF would continue to support the DoT&rsquo;s efforts to create a comprehensive social security safety net, aimed at expanding access benefits to road users previously and currently excluded by virtue of fault. Prior to joining the RAF, Jabavu was the COO at the Office of the Auditor-General and served as executive head for corporate services at the Independent Development Trust. She has also previously served as head of support services at the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee.
