Uasa on Thursday said a strike in the sugar industry had been averted following the conclusion of an across the board wage agreement. The Sugar Industry Bargaining Council and Uasa this week finally agreed to a 7.5% increase, to be implemented from April 1, after hitting an impasse in May with a 6.5% offer on the table. &ldquo;[That offer was] unacceptable to our members, hence we declared a dispute at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration,&rdquo; Uasa said in a statement. The wage dispute was finally settled on July 4; however, the issue of sick leave was referred to the bargaining council for further discussion.
