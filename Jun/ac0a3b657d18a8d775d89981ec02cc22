Jobs in the formal nonagricultural sector declined by 48 000, or 0.5%, to 9.64-million in the quarter ended March 31, Statistics South Africa&rsquo;s (Stats SA&rsquo;s) Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) report has revealed. This was mainly driven by trade and finance and business services, which lost 32 000 jobs and 23 000 jobs respectively. Jobs losses were also observed in community and social services with 8 000 jobs, manufacturing with 4 000 jobs and transport with 1 000 jobs lost. However, the QES observed an increase in the construction industry of 12 000 jobs and in the mining industry of 8 000 jobs. Year-on-year, statistics showed employment to have decreased by 58 000, owing to downscaling in the community services, transport services and finance and business services sectors. Total earnings paid to employees also declined quarter-on-quarter by R19-billion, to R588-billion. However, this was R33-billion higher than last year. The decrease in gross earnings was led by the manufacturing industry, as well as declines in earnings in the trade, community services, construction, transport and electricity industries. However, there was a quarter-on-quarter increase in gross earnings in the finance and business services industry.
