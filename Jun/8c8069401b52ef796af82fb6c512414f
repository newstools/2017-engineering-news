Banking giant FNB on Wednesday unveiled the latest addition to its mobile banking application, the nav&raquo; Car, developed in conjunction with WesBank, in the next chapter of the group&rsquo;s ambition of building a seamless digital banking ecosystem aimed at making things easier for the customer. Following the successful launch of nav&raquo; Home last year, which is now used by some 500 000 customers, nav&raquo; Car is the natural next step in the deployment of the nav&raquo; platform series for FNB, particularly as consumers typically spend the bulk of their income on these two aspects of their lives. The nav&raquo; Home and nav&raquo; Car formed the first two smart management solution executions of FNB&rsquo;s ambitions of bringing its true platform to the fore, FNB CEO Jacques Celliers told media at the launch in Parktown. FNB described nav&rsaquo;&rsaquo; as a financial GPS providing helpful solutions and a range of management tools to mitigate the &ldquo;several pain points&rdquo; often faced by customers in &ldquo;navigating&rdquo; certain financial aspects of their lives. It was somewhat of a &ldquo;control panel for life&rdquo; combining technology and finance, with the bank continuing to mature these product offerings over the next few years. &ldquo;Nav&raquo; provides customers with the ability to navigate their financial journey and provide new smart tools that will help manage their life in a simpler manner,&rdquo; said nav&rsaquo;&rsaquo; chief imagineer (CEO) Joland&eacute; Duvenage. With nav&raquo; Car, customers can access easy licence disc renewal by a one-off scan of the licence disc, proactive notifications, in-app payment and delivery options for R199. Further, the app featured an &ldquo;on-the-go fine shortcuts&rdquo;, which enabled the client to view any minor road infringements, with instant fine notifications and easy in-app payment. A &ldquo;garage management&rdquo; feature allowed the management of the details of up to five vehicles and provided access to the car&rsquo;s specification and instant car value estimate, with WesBank-financed customers obtaining easy access to important information like vehicle registration certificates. A WesBank-financed vehicle will be auto-loaded or a client could manually enter or scan the vehicle&rsquo;s licence discs for inclusion. Meanwhile, a paid-for product bundle, &ldquo;On-road Protect&rdquo;, will offer vehicle licence renewal for up to five discs with free delivery, a fine discounts negotiation service, 24/7 bail assistance at roadblocks and Road Accident Fund claim and pothole-damaged tyre repair claim assistance, for R95 a month. The nav&raquo; Car features will be significantly expanded as FNB develops additional solutions for customer requirements.
