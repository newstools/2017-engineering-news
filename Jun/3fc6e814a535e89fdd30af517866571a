South Africa&#39;s ruling African National Congress (ANC) does not believe that the country&#39;s top anti-graft agency has the power to ask parliament to change the mandate of the central bank, the party&#39;s Treasurer General said on Friday. Zweli Mkhize was clarifying that the party&#39;s position matched that of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who earlier delivered a stout defense of the central bank&#39;s independence at the start of an ANC policy conference. The public protector&#39;s call for an overhaul of the bank&#39;s mandate rattled investors, hit the rand currency and exposed worsening divisions between state institutions in South Africa, where President Jacob Zuma is embroiled in a widening net of scandals.
