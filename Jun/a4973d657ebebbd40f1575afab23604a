State-owned Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) is offering new lease agreements for more than 30 properties and operational sites in the Port of Durban&rsquo;s Ship Repair and Bayhead precincts. The commercial sites, which can be leased for a minimum of five years, present opportunities for new entrants, which have a minimum 51% black ownership, to participate in port-related activities. TNPA Port of Durban manager Moshe Motlohi says this exercise is part of transforming the port space and making it more inclusive for interested businesses, especially new entrants. &ldquo;This is the first ever real estate lease application exercise of this magnitude and we hope that it will be well received by the public, especially for communities residing in and around the Port of Durban,&rdquo; he said. The commercial sites range in size from 14 m2 to 5 000 m2 and are mostly used for port and logistics related activities such as light industrial engineering workshops, repair operations and storage warehouses. The properties also include a restaurant which caters for the Bayhead industrial workers market and sites suitable for local sporting bodies, boating clubs and fishing clubs. The Port of Durban has been leasing these properties on a month-to-month basis to a group of businesses for more than 20 years. Most of the existing leases were coming to an end. Current tenants are encouraged to participate in the process; however, further recognition will be given to new entrants and applicants who have a minimum of 51% black ownership.
