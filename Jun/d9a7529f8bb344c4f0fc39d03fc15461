Solidarity and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Thursday welcomed Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown&rsquo;s decision to rescind the reappointment of Brian Molefe as CEO of Eskom. The NUM said it was concerned about a lack of stability in Eskom&#39;s leadership and called on the Minister to address the issue :permanently and promptly&quot; as it &ldquo;poses challenges for the [utility&rsquo;s] employees and Eskom as a whole.&rdquo; Trade union Solidarity said it was also pleased by the decision to dismiss Molefe. Solidarity recently launched comprehensive legal action against the now former Eskom chief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Solidarity will, nonetheless, continue with the court action against Molefe and the Eskom board,&rdquo; Solidarity energy industry deputy general secretary Deon Reyneke said in a statement.
