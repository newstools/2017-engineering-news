Namibia will invest N$164-billion ($12.44-billion) over the next five years on plans which include upgrading and revamping hospitals, and building water and energy infrastructure, President Hage Geingob said on Wednesday. The investment package under a National Development Plan will be deployed on programmes and projects which also cover agriculture, technical and vocational training, and industrial development. &quot;This would involve modernising and upscaling our production sectors and systems including agriculture, manufacturing, fisheries, mining and tourism,&quot; Geingob said at the launch of the programme. &quot;By focusing on these sectors, we should be able to create more jobs to absorb new entrants into the labour market.&quot; The programme would also promote investments by independent power producers to meet growing electricity demand in the uranium-rich country. Namibia, which suffers from perennial drought, also intends to use sea water by building a desalination plant, a move that it hopes will turn coastal towns into agricultural production hubs.
