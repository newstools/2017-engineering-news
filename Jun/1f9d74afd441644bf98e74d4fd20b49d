The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Sdumo Dlamini hopes the African National Congress&rsquo; (ANC&rsquo;s) fifth National Policy Conference will restore unity in the tripartite alliance. Speaking at the policy conference on Friday in Johannesburg, Dlamini expressed his disappointment with the decision of the ANC stalwarts to boycott the first two days of the conference. &ldquo;We, as Cosatu, are of the view that the stalwarts are not pushing their views but wish to discuss their concerns. We would open our doors to them because we know that they are very important, given their years of experience in politics,&rdquo; said Dlamini. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini added that the issue of land was also important and that it would be given the platform it deserved. She hoped that issues associated with women abuse would also be discussed thoroughly, as they had been at the forefront lately. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said delegates would discuss the party&rsquo;s issues and &ldquo;come out united&rdquo;. Some of the delegates could be heard chanting songs at the conference, suggesting that Zuma must go, while others, such as those from KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State, sang songs that were questioning what was wrong with Zuma. Some ANC veterans were also present at the conference.
