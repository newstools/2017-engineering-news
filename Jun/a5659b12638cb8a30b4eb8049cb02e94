The Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) has issued 250 green building certifications in Africa, with the first school to achieve a Green Star rating representing a new milestone for the organisation as it enters its tenth year of operation. This followed the achievement by Streetlight Schools&rsquo; Jeppe Park Primary of a four-star Green Star South Africa Interiors v1 certification earlier this month. &ldquo;We are encouraged to see that green building continues to gain momentum across the continent. It is clear from the increasing number of GBCSA certified buildings that it makes good business sense and that the property sector understands this,&rdquo; GBCSA CEO Dorah Modise said in a statement on Monday. The 250 certified properties, collectively spanning just under 3.8-million square metres, are expected to save about 450-million kilograms of carbon dioxide, 380-million kilowatt-hours of energy and 350-million litres of drinking water each year.
