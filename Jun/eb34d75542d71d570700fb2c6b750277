Former Agri SA deputy president Dr Theo de Jager has become the first South African to be elected president of the World Farmers&#39; Organisation (WFO), in Helsinki, Finland. The WFO is an organisation of agricultural producers that aims to strengthen farmers&rsquo; positions within value chains, with a particular focus on smallholder farmers. &ldquo;By advocating on behalf of farmers and representing their interests in international policy forums, the WFO supports farmers in better managing extreme price volatility, leveraging market opportunities and timely access to market information,&rdquo; said Agri SA president Johannes M&ouml;ller. Congratulating his former colleague, M&ouml;ller added that constructive engagement with the WFO under the leadership of De Jager, will ensure the WFO continues to be instrumental in creating a conducive environment for agricultural investment and development in the world. Agri SA also congratulated Alfred Banda, a fellow African elected as board member for the African continent.
