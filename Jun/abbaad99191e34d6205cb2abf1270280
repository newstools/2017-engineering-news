The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said on Tuesday it has filed an application to the High Court challenging a recommendation by the country&#39;s main anti-graft watchdog to change the bank regulator&#39;s mandate. Governor Lesetja Kganyago said in court filings that the proposal by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to strip the bank&#39;s mandate of maintaining currency and price stability would undermine SARB&#39;s role in keeping the financial system stable.
