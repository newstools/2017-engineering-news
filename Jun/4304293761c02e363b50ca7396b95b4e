The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to implement the Centre for Trade and Regional Industrialisation&rsquo;s programmes. The Pretoria-based centre, launched by Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies in March, will strengthen regional integration through research to support the continental integration processes, as well as build the capacity of Africa&rsquo;s trade negotiators in the ongoing tripartite free trade area and continental free trade area negotiations. The MoU was signed by DTI director-general Lionel October and the UNDP South Africa resident representative Gana Fofang. The programme will promote the development of regional value-chains to foster diversification and structural transformation, with October noting that the continent&rsquo;s reliance on exports of primary products was unsustainable and that there was a need to promote value addition. &ldquo;Our collaboration will enable the centre to develop tools, methodologies and knowledge for strengthening the implementation and monitoring of regional integration, promoting intellectual exchange among multiple stakeholders and across disciplines. We will also promote the dissemination of policies and best practices in the sub-region to support the development of policies at national level,&rdquo; said Fofang. The centre would further cultivate strategic partnerships with a range of research and policy institutions within the continent and other regions, to ensure results.
