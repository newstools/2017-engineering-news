From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Sustained lower commodity prices and ever-increasing costs are &lsquo;squeezing&rsquo; mining margins and threaten the industry&rsquo;s survival. Therefore, mining machinery manufacturer GST Drilling says that products like the Safe Quality Stoping face advance rig can go a long way towards remedying this challenge. Simone Liedtke tells us more.
