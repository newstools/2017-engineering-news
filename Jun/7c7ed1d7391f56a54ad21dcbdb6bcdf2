South Africa is likely to miss revenue forecasts set out in a February budget while weakness in running of state-owned companies will be a risk to fiscal deficit targets, Fitch director Jan Friederich said on Thursday. Friederich said business confidence had been dented by political infighting within the ruling African National Congress ahead of a party conference in December when a successor to President Jacob Zuma will be chosen. &quot;The ANC electoral conference in December 2017 will be key moment on the political scene,&quot; Friederich said in a recorded video aired at a banking conference in Johannesburg. &quot;There is a high risk that the policy environment will remain volatile even after the ANC has elected new leaders.&quot;
