Consulting Engineers South Africa (Cesa) has received more than 47 submissions for this year&rsquo;s Aon Engineering Excellence Awards. Cesa CEO Chris Campbell said the event, which will be held on August 16, would highlight innovation, quality, outstanding workmanship and professionalism in the engineering industry. &ldquo;The awards provide Cesa with the opportunity to showcase the extent to which local built-environment professionals provide the best in engineering expertise. The occasion is about recognising and thanking all the participants for the role they play in the country&rsquo;s infrastructure development, a key requirement for economic growth of our country,&rdquo; he highlighted. However, Cesa noted that the industry was not without challenges, with consulting engineers often faced with &ldquo;unreasonable expectations&rdquo; from clients, including discounts on professional service fees, while the risks related to overly aggressive bidding remained that of the service provider. &ldquo;Competition is good and always encouraged but surely there is a tipping point where quality is compromised and risks unduly increase. Such practice is unsustainable for our industry and clients need some level of education on the real value of such services,&rdquo; Campbell added. &nbsp; &nbsp;
