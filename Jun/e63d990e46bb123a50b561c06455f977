Road Accident Fund (RAF) CEO Dr Eugene Watson will step down from his position at the end of June, it said on Wednesday. A successor has not yet been appointed. &ldquo;While Watson&rsquo;s five-year term is drawing to a close, his legacy will reverberate for years to come, as he has been pivotal in changing the trajectory of the organisation for the better,&rdquo; the RAF said in a statement. Under Watson&rsquo;s guidance, the RAF embarked on introducing the Road Accident Benefit Scheme (RABS) Bill, which is now before Parliament. The Bill proposes a comprehensive social security safety net that is not fault-based, allowing greater access to benefits to road users, particularly to lower-income groups, public and private transport passengers, widows, orphans and other dependants, previously and currently excluded by virtue of fault. RABS will also provide proactive assistance to crash victims and family members with the emphasis on effective access to medical and vocational rehabilitation to improve victims&rsquo; chances of re-entering the employment sphere and mainstream economy. &ldquo;Despite being insolvent since 1981, owing to undercapitalisation and an inadequate funding model, the fund&rsquo;s fundamental business of claims processing has improved under Dr Watson&rsquo;s leadership,&rdquo; the RAF said. It added that its productivity increased and, consequently its expenditure, resulting in the fund using all available cash. &ldquo;Notwithstanding the cash constraints, Watson continued to steer the organisation on its transformative path with strategies being fulfilled, the backlog of open claims being reduced, fraudsters being arrested, and more claimants being assisted daily, resulting in positive audit outcomes and, for the first time ever, three consecutive clean audits.&rdquo;
