The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has confirmed it will participate in further meetings with employers in the metals and engineering sector to resolve a wage dispute. Further negotiations will take place on June 28 and 29, and again on July 5 and 6. In a statement released on Tuesday, Numsa said it has been forced into a deadlock by employers after rejecting their proposed 5.3% wage increase earlier this month. Numsa reiterated its demand for a 15% increase in wages across the board based on the&nbsp;actual rate that a worker earned, not on the minimum rate. It was also seeking a two-year agreement. &ldquo;We also demand the extension of the agreement to nonparties, including the National Employers Association of South Africa,&rdquo; the trade union said. Numsa added that employers in the sector wanted a three-year wage agreement and were offering 5.3% across the board for the first year of the agreement, based on the&nbsp;minimum rate,&nbsp;and not the actual rate that workers were earning.
