Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has terminated Overberg Water&rsquo;s entire board, with immediate effect, citing financial irregularities. Overberg Water acting CEO Nthabiseng Fundakubi has also been recalled from her position. In March 2016, the Department of Water and Sanitation launched a forensic investigation into the entity, which found that the board &ldquo;may have failed to comply with its fiduciary duties&rdquo;. On April 29, Mokonyane issued a notice to terminate the board&rsquo;s term of office, providing them 14 days to deliver written reasons why their appointments should not be terminated. &quot;After considering the board&rsquo;s collective response, we are convinced that terminating the term of office is the correct and reasonable action to take,&rdquo; said Mokonyane, adding that the board also failed to submit Overberg Water&rsquo;s yearly financial statements to the National Treasury on September 30, 2016. Meanwhile, Phakamani Buthelezi, the Breede-Gouritz Catchment Management Agency&rsquo;s current CEO has now been seconded to the role of Overberg Water acting CEO.
