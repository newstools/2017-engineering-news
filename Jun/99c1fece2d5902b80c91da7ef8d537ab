Commuters in the Johannesburg central business district can expect traffic disruptions for the remainder of this month, as the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) upgrades the Harrison Street and Queen Elizabeth bridges. The agency on Monday said that, during weekdays, one slow lane on the Queen Elizabeth bridge would be closed to traffic from 09:30 to 14:30 and from 19:00 to 05:00, while one slow lane will be closed to traffic from 19:00 on Friday to 05:00 on Monday, over weekends. In Harrison street, temporary road warning signs and barricades have been installed. One lane will be permanently closed for the duration of the construction period. &ldquo;The two Braamfontein-based bridges form part of the city&rsquo;s arterial transportation network and are ageing and deteriorating, requiring urgent repairs and rehabilitation to safeguard all road users,&rdquo; the JRA noted.
