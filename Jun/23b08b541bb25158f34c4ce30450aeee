South African Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba reiterated his support on Friday for the independence of the central bank, saying an anti-corruption agency overstepped the mark this month in suggesting changes to its anti-inflation mandate. In a speech at the start of a major ruling party policy conference, Gigaba also called for &quot;drastic measures&quot; to kick-start growth in Africa&#39;s most sophisticated economy, now mired in its first recession in nearly eight years.
