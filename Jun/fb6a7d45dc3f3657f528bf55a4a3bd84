National Treasury has announced Dondo Mogajane as its new director-general (DG) after Cabinet confirmed his appointment on Wednesday. This follows the resignation of respected DG Lungile Fuzile last month. Fuzile asked to be released from his duties a year before his contract could come to an end in May 2018. He asked for a redetermination of his contract shortly before the axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan in the Cabinet reshuffle at the end of March. More than 30 people applied for the director-general position after it was advertised on April 28. Mogajane, who was the deputy director-general responsible for the public finance division, had been acting in the position since Fuzile&rsquo;s departure. He joined the National Treasury in 1999 and he has worked in various areas including, among others, the Intergovernmental Relations, Provincial Budget Analysis and International Economic Relations divisions. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed Mogajane&rsquo;s appointment. DA spokesperson on finance, David Maynier, said Mogajane&rsquo;s appointment puts to rest fears that a rogue may have been appointed to the top job at National Treasury. &ldquo;The fact is Dondo Mogajane is a career professional with nearly eighteen years of service in senior positions within National Treasury,&rdquo; Maynier said. &ldquo;We wish him well because he is going to have his hands full fighting off the fixers, rent seekers and state capturers who are desperate to get their hands on National Treasury.&rdquo;
