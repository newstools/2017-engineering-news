Advocate Geoff Budlender&#39;s report into the investigation of Gupta-linked company Trillian Capital has revealed shocking instances of corruption. Outgoing Trillian chair Tokyo Sexwale discussed the report with reporters on Thursday afternoon, and called for the report to be included in a judicial inquisition. He said this was his last day at Trillian and he was resigning after the press conference. Budlender criticised Trillian&#39;s lack of cooperation with his probe. He said the conduct of Trillian management in the inquiry had left him with the impression that what it says cannot be trusted. &ldquo;They have obstructed this investigation. The question is why they have done so,&rdquo; he asked in the report. Budlender said the investigation is still incomplete, and more work needs to be done to highlight the full extent of the corruption at Trillian. Sexwale appealed to reporters not to blame the staff. &ldquo;They are innocent. They are good people,&rdquo; he said. Sexwale singled out 60% shareholder Salim Essa for many of Trillian&rsquo;s corruption problems. He said Essa, the majority shareholder of Trillian, has refused to meet him. Tokyo lashed out at the Gupta family and said they have destroyed the African National Congress. &ldquo;This corruption of state capture related to a particular family. It is destroying my organisation,&quot; Sexwale said. Budlender&#39;s investigation also probed allegations that Trillian was going to benefit from state contracts under former finance minister Des van Rooyen. The explosive report details other situations that have been in the public domain related to alleged State capture.
