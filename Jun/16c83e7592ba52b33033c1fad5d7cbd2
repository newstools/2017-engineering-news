Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) is introducing three digital business solutions to enhance its business and customer relations. Through Transnet Online, the parastatal seeks to unlock digital value. Formerly known as R2R, Transnet Online is available for customers to download from Google Play and Apple iTunes. The app allows customers to track and trace their commodities, containers, bulk and automotive traffic across the value chain in real-time and to see on a map of South Africa where their consignment is at any point in time. Through an online ordering system, TFR customers can order their next-week business resources online and receive instant feedback regarding the acceptance of their orders. For the initial phase, the online ordering system will go live for mega- and flexi-customers. The parastatal also introduced an interactive wagon placement optimisation solution, which will help monitor wagons at different sidings, providing correct and accurate near real-time information. Customers will be able to access the information to proactively manage their value chain and ensure the efficient offloading, loading and release of wagons to avoid any penalties applicable to wagon delays. From a TFR perspective, the operational teams can effectively count down trains to ensure on-time departures.
