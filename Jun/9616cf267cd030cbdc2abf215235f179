Earthmoving equipment dealer Bell Equipment has signed an agreement with Japanese excavator specialist Kobelco Construction Machinery for the exclusive distribution and support of the Kobelco range of excavators in the Southern African region. Bell will complement its extensive product range by developing the full range of Kobelco excavators, from the small 1 t mini excavators through to the largest 85 t units. This will offer customers options for the smallest applications as well as competitively priced and perfectly matched loading tools for Bell articulated dump trucks in the construction, quarrying and mining industries. Kobelco&rsquo;s equipment is also well-suited for use in the forestry industry, a key market segment for Bell. &quot;The Kobelco focus on product innovation and efficiency resonates with our own ideologies. We share a number of dealers around the world, especially because Kobleco products offer overall reliability and low fuel consumption delivered by the Toyota Group&#39;s Hino engines,&quot; Bell Equipment Group marketing director Stephen Jones said in a statement. Kobelco Construction Machinery Middle East and Africa MD John Boyd added that Kobelco believes it has found the right partner for its products in the region. &quot;We are fortunate to have teamed up with a leading capital equipment distributor in Southern Africa, and also a like-minded company that believes in listening to its customers and reacting quickly,&quot; he noted. Teams from the respective companies are laying the foundations to ensure that they are able to meet customer expectations. &quot;Stocking of [Kobelco] parts in the Bell Global Logistics Centre is under way and technical staff are being upskilled to deal with the new products. Likewise, sales and application specialists are improving their knowledge to better advise and support customers to make the best application decisions,&quot; said Jones.
