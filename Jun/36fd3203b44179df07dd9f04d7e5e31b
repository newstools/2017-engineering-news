Gauteng&rsquo;s decreasing dam levels week-on-week, along with below-average winter rainfalls, are starting to worry the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS), which, on Tuesday called on stakeholders to use water sparingly. &ldquo;As the system operating forum plan to meet this month to consider the operating rule for the 2017/18 hydrological year, both the public and industry are encouraged to adhere to their municipality&rsquo;s advice on conserving water,&rdquo; the department said in a statement. &ldquo;Facing the prospect of continued dwindling dams week-on-week, the DWS appeals to all concerned to relieve pressure on water resources by using it only for their essential needs,&rdquo; it continued. This week saw a 0.5% decline to 84.1% in the level of the Integrated Vaal River System, which serves mainly Gauteng, Sasol and Eskom. The Vaal dam itself decreased 1% week-on-week to 98.9%. The dam&rsquo;s level was 40.4% during the corresponding week last year. The Katse dam, however, dropped well below last years level of 60.6%, with a 1.2% week-on-week decline putting the dam&rsquo;s water level at 43.2%. The Sterkfontein dam&rsquo;s level decreased 0.1% to 90.4%, while the Grootdraai dam&rsquo;s level contracted 0.5% to 89.8% and the Bloemhof dam decreased 0.4% to 101.6%.
