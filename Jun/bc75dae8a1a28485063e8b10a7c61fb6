South Africa&#39;s National Treasury said on Thursday it remains focused on fiscal consolidation and improving economic growth after Fitch ratings agency affirmed its subinvestment grade rating. Ratings agency Fitch kept South Africa&#39;s sub-investment grade rating on Thursday with a stable outlook, warning weak economic growth remained a key risk. Fitch downgraded South Africa to BB+ from BB- on both foreign and local currency debt in early April after a Cabinet reshuffle that saw respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan dismissed. &quot;South Africa&#39;s ratings are weighed down by low trend GDP growth, sizeable contingent liabilities and deteriorating governance,&quot; Fitch said in a statement. &quot;Positively, they are supported by deep local capital markets, a favourable government debt structure and a track record of fairly prudent fiscal and monetary policy.&quot;
