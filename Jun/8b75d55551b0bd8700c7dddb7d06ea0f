South Africa&#39;s Treasury on Tuesday said it was in talks with banks to possibly roll over around R9-billion ($695-million) worth of maturing debt due by struggling State airliner South African Airways (SAA) at month-end, a senior official said. Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane told legislators that should SAA fail to meet it debt obligations, it would have ripple effects on the government&#39;s entire guarantee framework.
