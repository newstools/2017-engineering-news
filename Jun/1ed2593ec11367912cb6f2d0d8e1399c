MANILA &ndash; China&#39;s iron-ore futures bounced back from a seven-month low on Wednesday, tracking a recovery in steel prices, although concerns over surplus supply kept gains in check. The rebound may help stabilise spot iron-ore prices that hit their lowest level in a year this week. China&#39;s steel output rose 1.8% in May from a year earlier, government data showed, near April&#39;s record level as mills ramped up production amid robust margins. The most-traded iron-ore contract for September delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed up 1.2% at 432 yuan ($64) a tonne, after falling as far as 412.50 yuan, the lowest since Nov. 21. But rising supply of the steelmaking commodity in China remains a concern for market participants, limiting any price gains. Stockpiles of imported iron-ore at China&#39;s ports reached 140.05-million tonnes on June 9, the most since 2004, according to data tracked by SteelHome consultancy. &quot;Rising seaborne supply and high port stockpiles continue to weigh on prices,&quot; Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. &quot;Demand has also weakened as Chinese steel mills look to use more scrap steel in their blast furnaces,&quot; said Dhar, adding that scrap steel prices have fallen sharply following Beijing&#39;s crackdown on induction furnaces. China has vowed to shut by the end of June all producers of highly polluting low-quality steel that use induction furnaces which consume steel scrap as raw material. Iron-ore for delivery to China&#39;s Qingdao port fell 2.8% to $53.36 a tonne on Tuesday, the lowest since June last year, according to Metal Bulletin. Iron-ore has lost nearly a third of its value this year, underperforming other commodities such as nickel and oil. The most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 3% to end at 3 084 yuan per tonne after falling as much as 2% intraday. China produced 72.26-million tonnes of crude steel last month, not far below April&#39;s all-time high of 72.78-million tonnes. Data also released on Wednesday showed China&#39;s economy generally remained on solid footing in May with industrial output growing at a steady 6.5% pace.
