The Solidarity-ETM Labour Market Index (LMI) improved strongly to 47.8 index points in the first quarter of this year, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016&rsquo;s revised 42.2 index points. &ldquo;This is the best level we have seen since the third quarter in 2013 and is indicative of relatively friendlier labour conditions after a lengthy period of declining security,&rdquo; Solidarity economics researcher Gerhard van Onselen said on Monday. He added, however, that the index remained below 50, indicating that job and wage security were broadly declining, though at a slower pace. Van Onselen said an improvement in business cycle indicators had had the biggest positive impact on the LMI for the first quarter. &ldquo;We think this improvement is owing to sustained rand strength in 2016 . . . which has led to relatively improved business confidence and has relieved the pressures on import costs.&rdquo; Van Onselen pointed out that it remained to be seen whether the improvement in the LMI could be sustained in the following quarters. &ldquo;The present dilemma is that cyclical improvements in business cycle indicators in the first quarter, and a decrease in job insecurity, as measured by Solidarity Employee Confidence Index, could not overcome the stagnating conditions of the South African economy to avoid an official recession. &ldquo;This leads us to conclude that structural economic weaknesses arising from political uncertainty and a harmful antibusiness policy environment are presently weighing more than cyclical improvements,&rdquo; he said.
