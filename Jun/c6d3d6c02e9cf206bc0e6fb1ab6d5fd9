The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) is nearing completion on the R8-million Phase 1 upgrade of 2.65 km of the Robinson canal, one of the City of Johannesburg&rsquo;s oldest canals. The agency said the rehabilitation, which extends from Main street, passing through Selby and Ophirton and ending on Lake street, was necessitated because of climate change, with sporadic torrential downpours having increased since 2009, which has also led to increased flash flooding in urban areas. This has resulted in increased water volumes and a negative impact on the ageing stormwater infrastructure across the city. Repairs have now been undertaken on the canal linings, along with the rehabilitation of sinkholes, sludge and vegetation removal and gabion works. However, with multiple defects reported as part of initial site inspection, the scope of work was divided into three phases, with the first phase now 65% complete and expected to reach completion at the end of June. City of Johannesburg Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba said a number of trees that severely damaged the canal lining were removed and three major sinkholes, exceeding 2 m in length, as well as two minor sinkholes, were repaired. Missing sewer manhole covers were also replaced. Deteriorated linings and eroded concrete floors have been reconstructed, while desiltation and removal of debris has been undertaken and gabions have been installed to prevent further soil erosion. Phase 2 of the structural repairs are scheduled for the 2017/18 financial year, with a capital expenditure budget of R5-million. This phase will focus on the six-month repair of the underground channel which will require a high level of safety owing to the nature of trapped gases from the wastewater in the lower lying structure. The JRA is in the process of appointing contractors for Phase 2.
