GABORONE (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Botswana&rsquo;s diamond sector is not going to disappear but it is also not going to grow. Increasingly, Botswana is a services driven economy, with the real growth coming from the services sector, Econsult MD Keith Jefferis told the Botswana Resource Sector Conference on Monday. The era of Botswana being a mining driven economy had ended and foreign direct investment (FDI) into Botswana had collapsed. &ldquo;We have an FDI problem,&rdquo; Jefferis told the conference attended by Mining Weekly Online. Some 20 000 people were entering the labour market each year, but only 2 000 jobs a year were being created, with mining doing little on the jobs front. Diamonds exports, including aggregation, were still representing the overwhelming 74% of exports and the 20% unemployment rate was probably under recorded. &ldquo;Diamond sales have been very volatile,&rdquo; Jefferis said of the ten diamond sights a year, which he described as being &ldquo;very bad&rdquo; in 2014/15, when Debswana was producing more diamonds than it could sell, despite the cutback in production. However, recovery was good in 2016/17, with diamond mining, over the years, contributing 30% to Botswana&rsquo;s gross domestic product on average.
