The City of Johannesburg on Thursday announced the R42-million upgrade of Le Roux Avenue, one of the city&rsquo;s busiest roads, as part of its ongoing efforts to improve mobility within the city. MMC of Transport, Nonhlanhla Makhuba, said in a statement that the upgrade of Le Roux Avenue on the K101, from a single carriageway to a dual carriageway, was aimed at addressing congestion during peak periods and significantly reduce travelling times for the Midrand community. &ldquo;A traffic impact study conducted on Le Roux Avenue revealed that during weekday peak periods, Le Roux Avenue and Old Pretoria Main Road intersection had a traffic volume of 3,995 vehicles in the morning and 3,689 in the afternoon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Based on these high traffic volumes, a second right lane has been allocated to the east bound approach of Le Roux Avenue. The revised road design takes into account future growth projections that will see traffic volume increase by more than 50% by 2030.&rdquo; Makhuba said as part of the road widening project, relocation of services had also been undertaken. &ldquo;Municipal stormwater pipes located on Le Roux Avenue have also been extended to suit the dual carriageway, damaged roads signs have been replaced, new pavements have been constructed and new roads markings have been painted.&rdquo; The City of Joburg said the upgrade also included new layer works construction, rehabilitation of the existing carriageway and widening at various intersections which included Old Pretoria Main Road/Le Roux Avenue, Le Roux Avenue/Richards Drive, Le Roux Avenue/Morkels Close/Capital Hills Access and Pretoria Main (R101) Road/ Le Roux Avenue. The City said they expected the project to reach completion at the end of July 2017. &ldquo;I would like to thank our residents for their continued patience and support as we work towards improving the City&rsquo;s infrastructure and building a better Johannesburg,&rdquo; Makhuba said.
