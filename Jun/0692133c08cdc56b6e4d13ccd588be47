Mobile operator Cell C has progressed its plans to extend its commercial fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) offering with one network agreement with Openserve cemented and discussions under way with two open-access network providers for additional agreements. &ldquo;Customers that are in areas covered by Openserve can now join those already covered by Frogfoot, Mitsol and Vumatel and experience C-Fibre&rsquo;s exceptional pricing and truly uncapped offers,&rdquo; Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos said in a statement on Wednesday. C-Fibre, a key part of Cell C&#39;s focussed broadband strategy, has both symmetrical and asymmetrical offers on all these networks that allow users to select the service they need, at the price that best suits them. All offerings include free installation, free connection, a free Wi-Fi router with long-term evolution (LTE) failover, free 1 GB of LTE data a month for 12 months and personalised set-up by an experienced service agent.
