Consulting firm XA International Trade Advisors will, on June 14, host a workshop for domestic steel industry participants to meet and discuss possible solutions to the threat posed by rising steel imports. The workshop will look at the trend of increased global protection in the steel industry and seek to generate proactive interventions that will assist the downstream sectors in managing import threats. &ldquo;The sustainability and future existence of the steel sector as a whole &ndash; both upstream and downstream &ndash; is integral to achieving the country&rsquo;s economic support and development goals; however, for South Africa to survive the relentless infiltration of international competition, it requires synchronised efforts from all involved domestically,&rdquo; XA International said in a statement. The workshop will be held at the Birchwood Hotel and Conference Centre, in Johannesburg.
