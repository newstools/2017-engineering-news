South African Breweries (SAB) has announced the ten finalists for the 2016 class of its youth entrepreneurship programme, SAB KickStart Boost. &nbsp; Up to R3.1-million in business support and funding has been awarded between the finalists.&nbsp; &nbsp; SAB KickStart Boost provides established businesses assistance with expansion and support during an 18-month programme geared towards the development of youth entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The class of 2016 began their Kickstart journey in June 2016 when the #StartupTruck toured South Africa in search of attractive businesses seeking growth opportunities. &nbsp; The 25 initially selected candidates, drawn from a range of industries including health and wellness, marketing, agriculture, cleaning and manufacturing, embarked on an intensive business skills training journey tailored to develop business growth. The ten finalists are Bahle Nteleki,&nbsp;Cleopatra Simelane,&nbsp;Lebogang Lekalakala, Litha Ndabula,&nbsp;Jafta Skosana, Mbali Bhengu, Nthabiseng Lemena,&nbsp;Tshepo Mdake, Tumelo Pholwane and Zama Buthelezi. &nbsp; The finalists, aged between 22 and 35, &ldquo;are now focussed on working with their assigned mentor to unlock opportunities in their businesses that will take them to the next level&rdquo;, said SAB corporate affairs director Nirishi Trikamjee. &nbsp; He noted that, 11 months into the programme, the entrepreneurs are entrenched in their training. &nbsp; The ten finalists currently employ 48 staff between them, with 26 part-time workers. The combined number of employees is expected to eventually grow to more than 100, with 20 part-time workers. &nbsp; &ldquo;The next six months will see the group receiving business mentoring through our partner, The Awethu Project, in which the mentor will work through at least eight, one-on-one mentoring sessions,&rdquo; he said. Further, winners of the programme will be provided additional market access opportunities to expand their customer base, including exposure to big business. &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;SAB&rsquo;s involvement with helping entrepreneurs develop successful businesses aligns with government&rsquo;s goals to transform the small business sector.&rsquo;&rsquo; &nbsp; The winner and two runners-up will be announced in November.
