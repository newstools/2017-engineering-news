Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has appointed Shell South Africa upstream VP and chairperson Bonang Mohale as its CEO, effective July 1. Mohale, who succeeds Thero Setiloane after his term expired, said he would use his new position to create a South Africa that works for all. &ldquo;In the next year, my focus will be to reassert business as the solution and not the enemy because when business does well, society does well; help combat State capture; work with labour and government to get the economy out of this recession and going again; create jobs; and accelerate transformation,&rdquo; he noted. Mohale further said he planned to reposition business as a trusted adviser and partner of choice, while doing everything possible to make government a capable State. Mohale had been serving as BLSA deputy chairperson for the past eight months and will be succeeded by Hollard Insurance&rsquo;s Adrian Enthoven. &ldquo;The board of BLSA are delighted that someone of Mohale&rsquo;s calibre and immense leadership ability has agreed to steer the organisation through the most challenging environment the organisation has faced since 1994,&rdquo; said BLSA chairperson Jabu Mabuza. &ldquo;All South Africans seek unity around positive aspirations. It will be very important for business to be introspective about its position in society to inspire agreement and provide duty of care, skill and diligence to our shared vision of a growing, inclusive economy,&rdquo; added Mohale.
