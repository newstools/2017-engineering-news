Sasol on Thursday reported that construction of its new alkoxylation plant in Nanjing, China, has started, with the new plant expected to be fully operational by early 2019. The new production unit will modernise and expand Sasol&#39;s current alkoxylation capacity, research and development facility and technical support capability in Nanjing, while strengthening its position in China and allowing it to better meet the growing demand for specialty chemicals in this growth market. This project entails the construction of an alkoxylation plant with a capacity of about 150 000 t/y, with the option of using either branched or linear alcohols to meet differentiated customer requirements in applications such as detergent, personal care, textiles and leather, metal working and lubrication, paper inks and coatings and the oil and gas recovery markets. &quot;With China&#39;s economy forecast to represent 40% of the world chemical demand by 2020 and its ongoing shift towards high-value and differentiated segments, China is an important market for Sasol. The new production unit will more than double Sasol&#39;s alkoxylation production capacity and Sasol&#39;s state-of-the-art technology offers our business partners significant benefits in terms of safety, reliability and flexibility,&rdquo; said Sasol chemicals business VP Fleetwood Grobler. The new site, located in the Nanjing Chemical Industrial Park, occupies about 35 acres.
