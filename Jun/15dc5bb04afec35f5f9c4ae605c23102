The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has gazetted a discussion document following a review of the procompetitive conditions imposed on licensees in the 2014 mobile call termination rate and fixed call termination rate regulations. Stakeholders now have 21 days from June 9 to provide comment and input into the outcomes of the review. Earlier this year, Icasa undertook the review to determine whether to modify the conditions under the regulations or maintain them until their expiration on September 30. However, the review found that the four market failures determined in the 2014 regulations still exist, including a lack of provision of access, the potential for discrimination between licensees offering similar services, a lack of transparency and inefficient pricing. Icasa further noted that competition in mobile termination markets and fixed termination markets still remained ineffective and that each individual Electronic Communications Network Service and Electronic Communications licensee that offered wholesale voice call termination services continued to have significant market power in respect of access to their own networks. The definitions of mobile termination markets and fixed termination markets in terms of regulation 3 of the 2014 call termination regulations remain unchanged and procompetitive conditions imposed on licensees in 2014 are still relevant. While market failure continued to exist, the authority noted that the current regulations had achieved a more efficient and effective access regime, a dynamic retail environment and continued access and investment in electronic communications networks. Depending on the outcome of its consultations, Icasa could initiate the next phase of the review and determine suitable termination rates by September 30.
