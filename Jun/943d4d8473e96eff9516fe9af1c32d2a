Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) logistics company Petredec has entered into an agreement with bulk liquid storage operator Bidvest Tank Terminals to develop a new 22 600 t facility for the import and storage of LPG at Bidvest&rsquo;s site, in Richards Bay. The completed facility will be the region&rsquo;s largest pressurised LPG import terminal, featuring four mounded tanks, each capable of storing more than 5 500 t of gas, guaranteeing year-round availability. Despite growing demand in domestic and regional markets, LPG imports have historically been hampered by high costs resulting from South Africa&rsquo;s small coastal terminals and distance from major supply hubs. The commissioning of this new large-scale facility &ndash; also capable of seaborne re-exports to neighbouring countries &ndash; will unlock previously unattainable economics resulting in lower supply prices to the local market. With the sodturning planned for September and an estimated 27-month construction schedule, South African consumers can expect to be using LPG imported through the new Richards Bay terminal from the fourth quarter of 2019. Dedicated 24-hour road tanker and railcar loading facilities will ensure supplies 365 days a year, enabling local LPG marketers to guarantee product availability to their customers throughout South Africa. Petredec already supplies most of South Africa&rsquo;s imported LPG and believes further investment in large, dedicated infrastructure is the only way to increase the fuel&rsquo;s popularity and lower prices for consumers. Petredec CEO Giles Fearn said the company&rsquo;s commitment to the development of the Southern African LPG market underlined its confidence in the growth potential of this region. &ldquo;Delivering LPG to South Africa on a previously unprecedented scale brings with it financial savings to our customers that will ultimately benefit consumers with lower gas prices.&rdquo; Bidvest Tank Terminals MD David Leisegang added that the new facility would add significantly to the more than 3.5-billion litres of bulk liquid product that is currently handled through local terminals every year.
