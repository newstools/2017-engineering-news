JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; The Chamber of Mines of South Africa will be applying at the earliest opportunity for a court date for a declaratory order on continuing empowerment consequences, as well as immediately seeking an interim court interdict to suspend the implementation of Mining Charter Three, the devastating set of new legal requirements that Minerals Minister Mosebenzi Zwane on Thursday unleashed on the already battered local mining industry. An initial reading of Mining Charter Three, which has been gazetted unilaterally by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), brings out an ominous range of brightly flashing red lights, including new ownership provisions and the establishment of the Mining Transformation and Development Agency without a substantive view of governance structures. &ldquo;We do believe that we have no choice but to apply for a court interdict to suspend the implementation of the charter and take the DMR charter on review. &ldquo;Our goal is not to avoid transformation. It is to engage properly with government and other stakeholders to find agreement on a rational, pragmatic, effective new charter that will take us further along the road to transformation,&rdquo; new chamber president Mxolisi Mgojo told a media conference attended by Mining Weekly Online. Mgojo, who is CEO of Exxaro Resources, one of South Africa&rsquo;s most successful black-controlled mining companies, described as &ldquo;most disappointing&rdquo; the need to get court support to try to resolve a crucial matter for what is already South Africa&rsquo;s most transformed industry, with: &bull; effective 38% black ownership compared with the new charter&rsquo;s requirement of 30%; &bull; empowerment transactions since 2000 worth R205-billion; &bull; meaningful economic transfer worth R159-billion; and &bull; more than 50% of management positions occupied by historically disadvantaged South Africans. &ldquo;We live in a democracy and it is within our rights to protect and defend the mining industry and we are going to do exactly that,&rdquo; Mgojo stated. What the Minister has enforced with immediate effect is: &bull; A minimum of 30% black ownership, made up 8% by an employee shareholding, 8% for mine communities and 14% for black entrepreneurs; &bull; A minimum of 50% black ownership, plus one black person shareholding, all with voting rights, for all new exploration licences; &bull; A board made up 50% by black directors, 25% of them women; &bull; Top management made up of 50% black management, 25% of them women; &bull; Middle management of 75% black management, with 38% of them women; &bull; Junior management of 88% black management, with 44% of them women; &bull; 70% of all mining goods bought must be from black economically empowered entities; &bull; 80% of all services must be sourced from black economically empowered entities; &bull; 100% of all mineral samples must be analysed by South African-based firms; &bull; 1% of the yearly turnover of foreign suppliers must be paid to the Mining Transformation and Development Agency; &bull; 11% will be offset against black economic empowerment requirements for companies that have been invested in mineral beneficiation since 2004; &bull; mining companies must provide decent housing, home ownership, social human settlements, affordable, equitable and sustainable health facilities and proper nutrition; &bull; 2% of the 5% skills levy must go on artisan training, bursaries, literacy and numeracy skills for employees and community members; &bull; 1% of the 5% skills levy must go to black academic institutions; and &bull; the remaining 2% of the 5% skills levy must be given to the Mining Transformation and Development Agency. &ldquo;The intention is to ensure transformation of the entire mining industry,&rdquo; Zwane told journalists. &ldquo;Once we have concluded our analysis on the amended charter, we&rsquo;ll release a detailed statement,&rdquo; the National Union of Mineworkers said in a release. &ldquo;The lack of meaningful engagement with the industry, and collective engagement with all stakeholders, has been most disappointing. We are exceedingly disappointed that the Minister has chosen not to use the traditional forums that have been in place for over a decade to engage meaningfully,&rdquo; Mgojo commented. &nbsp; Prior to its publication in the government gazette on Thursday, the chamber and its members had not had sight of the actual reviewed charter since the April draft was published in 2016.&nbsp; &nbsp; The new &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; provision incorporated into the newly gazetted charter may prove to be unconstitutional and will likely lead to further legal action by the industry, law firm Fasken Martineau partner Nicola Jackson said in a release. The &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; forces mining companies to include black entrepreneurs, employees and communities, and then empower their corporate structures again when black shareholders sell their stake in the company. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly arguable that this new &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; provision is unconstitutional as it attempts to impose retrospective obligations on already existing mining right holders,&rdquo; the law firm said. Mgojo reiterated that the chamber subscribed fully to the notion of inclusive growth, which required and enabling regulatory environment that facilities: The reality now was a damaging regulatory environment that is shrinking the economy, frightens away investment, sheds jobs and provides negligible scope for entrepreneurship. &ldquo;If you introduce new elements that take 1% from the revenue line, not even from the profit line, but from the revenue line, you&rsquo;re beginning to kill the goose that is supposed to be laying the golden eggs,&rdquo; Mgojo warned. The average 38% black economically empowered average ownership that the chamber states that its members already have includes what it refers to as &ldquo;continuing consequences&rdquo;, a reference to the &ldquo;once empowered, always empowered&rdquo; ruling that it will again be seeking through its application to the courts for a declaratory order on the matter.
