JSE-listed Stor-Age will acquire the Durban-based StorTown portfolio of self-storage assets from the DanCor Properties group, the self-storage real estate investment trust announced Thursday. The StorTown portfolio comprises four well-tenanted and geographically attractive properties in Brackenhill, Durban central business district and Durban North. &nbsp; Stor-Age&#39;s footprint will grow to five stores in Durban, offering more than 27 000 m&sup2; of gross leasable area (GLA). &ldquo;We are excited about this acquisition. It aligns with our strategy of targeting quality peers in a fragmented market, with a focus on the four major metropoles in South Africa on a complementary quality level to our existing portfolio,&quot;&nbsp;CEO Gavin Lucas said in a statement. Going forward, the properties will be rebranded and included into Stor-Age&rsquo;s operational platform, allowing for the benefit of economies of scale in the greater Durban market. &nbsp; The acquisition&nbsp;will increase Stor-Age&rsquo;s overall portfolio from 31 to 35 properties, as well as boost total GLA by more than 9% to about 255&nbsp;000 m&sup2;.
