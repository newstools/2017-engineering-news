South Africa&#39;s Cabinet has confirmed Dondo Mogajane as permanent director general at National Treasury, it said on Thursday. Lungisa Fuzile resigned as the department&#39;s highest official shortly after his political head, Pravin Gordhan, was removed as finance minister. Mogajane has worked for the department since 1999 and was most recently the deputy director-general responsible for public finance.
