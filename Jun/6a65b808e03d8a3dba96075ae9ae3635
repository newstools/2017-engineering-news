Parliament must consider an inquiry into the Eskom board&rsquo;s fitness to hold office if the board does not resign, says Southern African Catholic Bishops&rsquo; Conference (SACBC) Justice and Peace Commission chairperson Bishop Abel Gabuza. He called on the board to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; and resign following the recent reinstatement and subsequent removal of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. &ldquo;The various allegations against Eskom and the recent saga around the reinstatement of Brian Molefe indicate that the board is failing in its commitment to the principles of good governance. The Eskom board cannot therefore continue with business as usual,&rdquo; said Gabuza. He added that the report &#39;Betrayal of the Promise: How South Africa is Being Stolen&#39;, released by research partnership the State Capacity Research Project, which raises concerns about corruption and State capture, demonstrates that all State-owned entities need to be reviewed. Bad governance and &ldquo;plunder for the benefit of a few elite&rdquo; needed to be stopped, stated Gabuza. Meanwhile, the SACBC applauded the African National Congress (ANC) for condemning the recent activities at Eskom. &ldquo;This shows that, when it wants to, the ANC is capable of demanding accountability from its members who are deployed into the government and the State-owned enterprises. We call upon the ANC to show similar zeal when it is accountability matters relating to the President.&rdquo;
