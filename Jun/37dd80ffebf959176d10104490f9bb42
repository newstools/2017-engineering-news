The International Engineering Alliance (IEA) has recognised that the Engineering Council of South Africa&rsquo;s (ECSA&#39;s) standards and processes comply for an additional six years with the Washington Accord. &ldquo;The recognition of ECSA by the IEA reaffirms that ECSA conforms to global engineering education and competence standards,&rdquo; ECSA CEO Sipho Madonsela said in a statement on Tuesday. South Africa is the only African country that is a member of the IEA. Through ECSA, South Africa has begun an initiative to assist other African countries with their recognition to the accords and agreements in its role as the secretariat of the Southern African Federation of Engineering Organisations. &ldquo;This recognition provides ECSA with an opportunity to participate and positively contribute to an international platform of the engineering community by providing advice and guidance on policies, developments and innovative solutions on issues relating to engineering and technology,&rdquo; he added. ECSA further noted that it was encouraged by the confirmation of its standards and processes by the IEA for the Washington Accord education programmes and would continue to manage the regulation of the South African engineering profession to ensure its global competence.
