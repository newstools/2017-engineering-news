Alan Olivier will retire as CEO of JSE-listed Grindrod with effect from July 31. He will remain available to Grindrod&#39;s shipping division in a consulting capacity. The company will start the process of appointing a successor. Nonexecutive chairperson Mike Hankinson will, in the transitional phase, act as executive chairperson, with group FD Andrew Waller supporting him. &ldquo;On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Alan for his valued contribution to the group over the past 31 years, the last ten years as CEO. We wish him well and as Alan will be consulting to the shipping division, on an ad hoc basis, it is by no means goodbye,&rdquo; commented Hankinson. The three Grindrod divisions will continue to be managed by the skilled management team, Bongiwe Ntuli (freight services), Martyn Wade (shipping) and David Polkinghorne (financial services).
