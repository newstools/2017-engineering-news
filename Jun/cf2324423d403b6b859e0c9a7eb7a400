Telecommunications giant MTN on Friday set aside R1.5-million to contribute to relief efforts across the Western and Eastern Cape after storms and fires this week caused several deaths and displaced thousands of people, as well as causing structural infrastructure damage. The funds would be used to secure the critical essentials, as highlighted by the disaster management team, and included blankets, food parcels and water to assist people in need, said MTN South Africa corporate services executive Graham de Vries. MTN also dispatched an additional 14 engineers to the affected areas to help with expediting repairs to its equipment and restoring connectivity.
