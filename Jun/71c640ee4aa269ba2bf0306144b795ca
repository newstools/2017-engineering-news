The US Embassy in South Africa&rsquo;s office of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Friday donated $105 000 of border enforcement equipment and tools to the South African Revenue Service (Sars).&nbsp; The equipment will be used in support of Sars&rsquo; efforts to safeguard South Africa&rsquo;s borders.&nbsp; The donation includes vehicle global positioning system units, field binoculars, night vision goggles, handheld thermal imagers, radiation detectors and contraband detection kits.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;The donation is a part of the US Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s longstanding partnership with the government of South Africa to support border security, trade facilitation and combat wildlife trafficking,&rdquo; US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires Jessye Lapenn said. She noted that the equipment would be used to help conserve South Africa&rsquo;s diverse wildlife species, promote economic development and combat the multibillion-dollar illicit wildlife trade within the country&rsquo;s borders. &ldquo;I am proud of the great work our South African and American teams have done together on these issues.&nbsp; Together, we are making a difference,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp; &ldquo;This donation will strengthen our long-lasting relationship with the US, which has been assisting us since the 1990s. Our work together has helped us improve our fight against the illicit economy,&rdquo; commented Sars customs executive Mohamed Ally.
