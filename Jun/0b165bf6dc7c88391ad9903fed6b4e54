The deadline for the Presidential Commission report on the feasibility of free higher education and training coincided with the opening of African National Congress&rsquo; (ANC&rsquo;s) fifth National Policy Conference on Friday. President Jacob Zuma delivered the opening address to more than 3 000 delegates and highlighted that funding for higher education and jobs was a key issue affecting South Africa&rsquo;s youth. He said the conference came at an opportune time, as it would allow for robust discussion regarding the possibilities of providing quality, affordable higher education to as many South Africans as possible, as well as free education for the poor. &ldquo;The Freedom Charter emphasises that education shall be free, compulsory, universal and equal for all children; higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of State allowances and scholarships awarded on the basis of merit,&rdquo; Zuma pointed out. He also noted that the 2007 ANC Policy Conference resolved that &ldquo;free higher education for the poor up to undergraduate level must be progressively implemented&rdquo; and added that this sentiment was reiterated at the Mangaung conference in 2012. Meanwhile, the funds allocated to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme for loans and bursaries to students at public universities and Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges have increased substantially from more than R2-billion in 2009 to more than R12-billion in 2017. &nbsp; Edited by Ria Theron
