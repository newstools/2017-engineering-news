While Africa &ndash; the fastest-growing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market in the world today &ndash; is rich with potential for LPG industry players, distribution challenges, affordability and safety issues need to be addressed to capitalise on this potential, according to industry experts. This emerged ahead of the fourth edition of the Africa LPG Summit, which will be colocated with the CNG-NGV Africa Forum and held from July 11 to 12, in Johannesburg. While much has been done to make LPG more affordable and accessible in Africa, moving consumers from other fuels to LPG requires collaborative efforts, supportive government policies and more efficient training and distribution, says LPG Summit director and organiser Vincent Choy. &ldquo;This yearly gathering of the top LPG executives and policy makers in Africa aims to build a sustainable platform on which to promote LPG as a means of providing a modern, clean and convenient fuel for all,&rdquo; he says. This year, attendance at the summit is free, providing more leverage in bringing together the right stakeholders to hold the right discussion, Choy adds. &nbsp; More than 500 energy stakeholders and dignitaries from South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe are expected to meet at Emperor&rsquo;s Palace, east of Johannesburg, for the summit. The two-day event will be presented by the international LP Gas Summit, with the support of the South Africa Oil and Gas Alliance, the World LPG Association, the Petroleum Institute of East Africa and the Global LPG Partnership. The Africa LPG Summit will assess LPG demand, supply and growth potential across various regions of Africa, consider South Africa&rsquo;s potential role as Africa&rsquo;s LPG energy hub and discuss safety and consumer issues around LPG.&nbsp; It will also be used to assess the state of LPG markets, policies and infrastructure in Africa, as well as showcase the latest LPG technologies.
