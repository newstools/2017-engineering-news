A second round of applications has been opened to secure preferential access to coveted dotAfrica domain names under ZA Central Registry&#39;s (ZACR&#39;s) dotAfrica pioneer programme. This followed on the drive earlier this year to encourage Africa&#39;s leading brands to apply for their desired domain names. &ldquo;The second phase of the dotAfrica pioneer programme opens on June 9 and will run until June 23 to enable business, civil society and other interested parties across the continent to apply for preferred access to approved dotAfrica domains prior to general availability,&rdquo; said ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela. The general public will be able to register dotAfrica domain names when the launch phase of the new dotAfrica geographic top level domain (gTLD) launches from July 4. The decision was taken to &ldquo;reactivate&rdquo; the pioneer programme for the month of June after the interest generated surpassed the company&rsquo;s expectations. &ldquo;An approved dotAfrica domain name would enable individuals and organisations to showcase their brand and their commitment to the continent, while establishing a home for Africa-specific products and services. The new dotAfrica gTLD enables the acquisition of valuable online real-estate in a fast-growing and high-potential market,&rdquo; said Masilela. Applicants are required to highlight key innovative qualities of their organisations, emphasise their relevance to Africa and outline their ability to harness the dotAfrica domain name to amplify their brand journey, as well as showcase their plans to use the domain name to share Africa&rsquo;s message globally. &ldquo;Successful companies, nonprofit organisations, bloggers, celebrities and governments joining the pioneer programme will be granted access to the dotAfrica domain of their choosing,&rdquo; he concluded.
