JSE-listed real estate investment trust Stor-Age increased its divided by 10% year-on-year to R88.05 in the year ended March 31, and is expecting 9% to 10% dividend growth in the current financial year. The company noted that its results were driven by a strong trading performance across the portfolio and the successful completion of the Storage RSA acquisition in February. &ldquo;Stor-Age&rsquo;s performance reflects the recession-resilient nature of our self storage product. Demand remains strong as the underlying &lsquo;need&rsquo; prevails,&rdquo; said CEO Gavin Lucas. He noted that the self storage market was holding steady in contrast to other property subsectors in South Africa. During the year under review, Stor-Age&rsquo;s occupancy, excluding Storage RSA, increased by 4 000 m2. Including Storage RSA, the increase in occupancy was 37 700 m2, and the closing rental rate grew by 12.7% to R86. The company achieved a 9.4% increase in the average rental rate achieved for the year. Meanwhile, the Storage RSA acquisition had extended Stor-Age&rsquo;s gross lettable area, while also offering a development opportunity in Bryanston for which town planning approvals are in hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Further bolstering the group&rsquo;s geographical footprint, Stor-Age opened three new Stor-Age branded properties in Durban and Johannesburg in its managed portfolio.&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking ahead, Lucas said the group would focus on driving occupancies, rental rate and cash flow, ensuring that revenue translates into earnings and dividend growth.&nbsp; Stor-Age is in the second year of its defined five-year growth plan to 2020 and is currently ahead of growth targets, he noted.&nbsp; Acquisition-wise, Lucas stated that the company&rsquo;s short-term focus was on bedding down recent acquisitions to maintain consistent group standards and unlock maximum value. &nbsp; &ldquo;In line with our strategy, our healthy balance sheet opens the opportunity for continued organic and acquisitive growth going forward. More than 80% of net debt is hedged and gearing stands at a conservative 12%.&rdquo;
