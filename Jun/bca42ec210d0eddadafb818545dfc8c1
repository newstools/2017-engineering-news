Agricultural company Senwes has launched the first silo solar photovoltaic (PV) system in South Africa, at its Hennenman silo, in the Free State. &ldquo;Around 1 120 solar panels were installed, with a total capacity of 358 kW. The total projected solar utilisation is 472 460 kWh/y, which constitutes 62% of the total electricity consumption of the Hennenman silo and will result in a significant cost saving,&rdquo; Senwes CEO Francois Strydom said. He added that, in line with the company&rsquo;s sustainability objectives and contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, the solar PV system will save about 1 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt-hour. The projected carbon savings will amount to 472.5 t of CO2/y. The project started in January and was completed in April, when it was integrated into the existing electricity grid.
