Ratings agency Moody&#39;s Investors Service downgraded South Africa&#39;s state-owned utility Eskom on Tuesday following the lowering of the country&#39;s credit rating last week and said the outlook for the power company was negative. Moody&#39;s downgraded the long-term corporate family rating of Eskom and its zero coupon euro bonds to Ba2 from Ba1, leaving it two notches below investment grade. Eskom&#39;s probability of default rating was also downgraded to Ba2-PD from Ba1-PD. Moody&#39;s downgraded South Africa&#39;s credit rating on Friday but kept it at investment grade with a negative outlook, citing a recent cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects for an economy mired in recession. &quot;Given Eskom&#39;s strong linkage with the South African government and its high sensitivity to changes in the sovereign credit profile, the rating downgrades primarily reflect the one-notch downgrade of South Africa&#39;s ratings to Baa3 negative,&quot; Moody&#39;s said in a statement. &quot;The negative outlook reflects the negative outlook on the government of South Africa,&quot; it said.
