The Gauteng provincial government has appointed legal firm Adams and Adams to investigate the cause of a roof collapse at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital during maintenance works. &ldquo;[The firm will] provide a detailed report of what really transpired. We have also tasked the investigators to review the competence of all companies appointed to do maintenance in all our healthcare facilities in the province,&rdquo; said Infrastructure Development MEC Jacob Mamabolo. The site of the incident, which happened on Thursday, has been sealed off and the investigations will start immediately. The contractor has been removed from the site with immediate effect for the duration of the investigation. &ldquo;We will act firmly and swiftly to ensure that action is taken against anyone found responsible for this tragic incident,&rdquo; added Mamabolo. Five patients were treated and discharged, with none of the affected patients requiring emergency operation or admission following the structural failure. Preliminary indications suggest that the incident happened owing to a contractor stockpiling heavy concrete on the roof, which was not strong enough to carry the weight. Mamabolo added that claims that this particular incident happened because the building was neglected were false.
