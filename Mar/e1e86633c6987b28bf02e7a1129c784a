S&amp;P&#39;s Global Ratings reiterated its concerns on Tuesday about weak economic growth, political tensions and policy reform in South Africa, which faces the prospect of downgrades to its sovereign credit ratings which would raise the cost of borrowing. &quot;If we see a lot increasing political tensions, infighting in state institutions which could derail the government&rsquo;s plans in boosting economic growth then that can impact on our forecasts on growth,&quot; Gardner Rusike, S&amp;P&#39;s associate director told a conference.
