Transport Minister Dipuo Peters on Wednesday, dissolved the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board with immediate effect. This was revealed in Parliament when acting transport department director general Mathabatha Mokonyama read out a letter from Peters during a portfolio committee meeting. Democratic Alliance MP Manny de Freitas told African News Agency that &ldquo;essential she expressed concern about the drama, bad management and bad press and that she&rsquo;s dissolving the board with immediate effect&rdquo;. &ldquo;I suspect this thing was going to happen. I didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen so soon.&rdquo; The announcement came after a two day meeting of MPs with the Prasa board, the department of transport, and Collins Letsoalo &ndash; whose secondment from the department to Prasa as acting CEO was terminated by the board. African National Congress and Economic Freedom Fighters MPs laid the blame for the financial mess the state owned rail company at the feet of the board, going as far as calling them corrupt and useless.
