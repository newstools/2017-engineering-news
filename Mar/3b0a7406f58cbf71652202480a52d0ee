South Africa&#39;s Banking Association said on Friday that changing the finance minister and deputy finance minister raised &quot;alarming concerns&quot; for fiscal discipline issues. President Jacob Zuma replaced Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba in a cabinet reshuffle late on Thursday and appointed Sfiso Buthelezi as deputy finance minister, replacing Mcebisi Jonas, along with various other changes of ministers and their deputies.
