South African mobile phone operator MTN Group has limited room to increase its debt levels, rating agency Moody&#39;s said on Monday, citing lack of dividend flow from Nigeria &ndash; its biggest market. &quot;Financial flexibility could be restored should MTN be able to begin repatriating dividends from its Nigerian operations, however there is uncertainty over timing,&quot; Moody&#39;s said.
