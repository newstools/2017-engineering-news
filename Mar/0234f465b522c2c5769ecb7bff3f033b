Black-owned fishing company Sea Harvest Group on Thursday listed in the Farming, Fishing and Plantations sector on the JSE&rsquo;s main board. &nbsp; The listing will provide investors with more choice and an opportunity to participate in the income streams and future capital growth of Sea Harvest. &nbsp; &ldquo;Globally, consumers know that when they buy South African Cape Hake, they are getting superior quality from a well-managed fishery,&rdquo; CEO Felix Ratheb said. &nbsp;&nbsp; He added that the company would continue to focus on growth and expansion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pursuing organic growth through further margin-enhancing investment in our fleet and factories, as well as market diversification.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sea Harvest last year acquired a 56% stake in Australian firm Mareterram, which provides it with an existing platform and local knowledge to take advantage of the fragmented fishing sector in that country. &nbsp; Brimstone Investment Corporation has held on to a majority 54.9% share of Sea Harvest and is committed to remaining invested and supporting Sea Harvest&rsquo;s growth story.
