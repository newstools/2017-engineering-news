JSE-listed Attacq has welcomed BMW Group South Africa&rsquo;s (BMW SA&#39;s) decision to invest in the construction of a 32 000 m2 regional distribution facility at the Waterfall Distribution Campus, in Midrand, Gauteng. The value of this investment and the revamp of its headquarters, also in Midrand, totals R400-million. Attacq CEO Morn&eacute; Wilken said the company was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; to welcome a leading international brand like BMW to Waterfall. &ldquo;Waterfall is one of South Africa&rsquo;s largest mixed-use developments, which is attracting top international companies such as BMW,&rdquo; he said, adding that having BMW move its regional distribution facility to Waterfall was beneficial, as it would lead to the vertical integration of some of BMW&rsquo;s suppliers. &ldquo;I believe this will give us a lot more momentum; a lot of development can come from this - which is a big benefit for Attacq in the long term,&rdquo; he said. BMW SA will start construction on the facility this month. Distribution from the purpose-built facility is expected to start by mid-2018. Speaking at the sod-turning ceremony, on Wednesday, BMW SA and sub-Saharan Africa CEO Tim Abbot said that improved warehousing and distribution was a key success factor, and that the group &ldquo;keeps upping our game in customer service delivery. &ldquo;Space limitations restrict the expansion of the warehouse in our current location in Midrand. By moving the warehouse to a larger site, we also free up space on our campus to create a power hub,&rdquo; he added. Abbot noted that the facility, which is twice the size of the previous warehouse, would help BMW service sub-Saharan Africa more efficiently. He pointed out that the location of the facility, 7 km from BMW SA headquarters, in Midrand, provided a strategic advantage in servicing the region.
