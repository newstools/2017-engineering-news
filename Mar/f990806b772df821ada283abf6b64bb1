JSE-listed Huge Group on Monday announced the appointment of Zunaid Bulbulia as CFO, effective immediately. Bulbulia, who has been a nonexecutive director at Huge since January 2016, shortly after his exit as group chief operations executive at MTN, is succeeding group FD David Deetlefs, who will remain on the board as an executive director. Huge commented in a statement on Monday that Bulbulia played a &ldquo;pivotal role&rdquo; in the acquisition of the Connectnet Group, as well as in various mobile network operator interactions. &ldquo;Consequent to the recently announced acquisition of Connectnet Broadband Wireless and its wholly owned subsidiary company Sainet Internet, which is expected to be completed before the end of March, the board has decided that the company needs to establish a group structure that will allow it to manage effectively its existing operating companies and the future operating companies that it envisages acquiring,&rdquo; Huge said. In effect, this had made Bulbulia the first direct employee of Huge, with all other employees in the group being employed currently by the operating companies.
