President Jacob Zuma on Thursday said land restitution without compensation would not end in land grabs, but would restore dignity to poor South Africans. Zuma was responding to a debate in a sitting of the National House of Traditional Leaders in Parliament, and said the return of land to its rightful owners was crucial to effect radical economic transformation. &ldquo;No one is saying let us go and grab, no. We are saying let us do everything within the law,&rdquo; said Zuma, repeating his support for a Constitutional amendment which would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. &ldquo;We are not saying let us now go and take the land. We are saying let us amend the Constitution. Constitutions are amended all the time to fix wrongs,&rdquo; Zuma told the traditional leaders.
