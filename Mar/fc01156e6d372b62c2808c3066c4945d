The ongoing drought has exposed &quot;hazardous shortcomings&quot; in the planning and management of the country&rsquo;s water resources, according to report by Oxfam SA released on Tuesday. Government officials and politicians calling the drought a &quot;God-given&quot; event, and their palpable relief that rain had fallen in parts of the country, created the illusion that South Africa had survived the crisis. &quot;This denies the reality of severe drought as a slow-onset disaster that systematically strips away layers of resilience, resulting in poverty, insecurity and hunger for growing numbers of people.&quot; The report is entitled &quot;A Harvest of Dysfunction: Rethinking the Approach to Drought, its Causes and Impacts on South Africa&quot;. The devastation caused by the current drought was not simply a consequence of poor rainfall and the strongest El Ni&ntilde;o on record. &quot;It is a harvest of dysfunction, arising from South Africa&#39;s failure to address structural vulnerabilities.&quot; The had drought exposed critical fault lines in South Africa - including inequalities in income and access to land and water, which exacerbated the drought&#39;s impact. &quot;These weaknesses require urgent attention if the current and future combinations of recurrent droughts, stronger El Ni&ntilde;o effects and rising temperatures as a result of climate change are to be managed sustainably.&quot; GOVT REACTION &#39;SLOW, BADLY-TARGETED&#39; Oxfam SA criticised the government&rsquo;s reaction to the crisis as slow, sporadic, and badly-targeted. &quot;Despite the range and extent of impacts across society, it has not declared a national emergency.&quot; South Africa was a water-scarce country subject to recurrent droughts, and unless urgent action was taken, it faced the prospect that water supplies in more and more areas would run out. Food price escalations - resulting from an unregulated market and compounded by drought-induced supply constraints - were having a &quot;devastating impact&quot; on vulnerable people. Women were particularly affected. &quot;They are compelled to work ever harder to provide their families with the food and water they need to live healthy, productive and dignified lives.&quot; &#39;A NATIONAL DISASTER SHOULD BE DECLARED&#39; South Africa&rsquo;s food staple, white maize, was at the mercy of &quot;speculative and financial dynamics that extend beyond South Africa, placing the entire region&#39;s food security at constant risk&quot;. Oxfam recommended that the government redefine drought to enable a more appropriate response. &quot;A national disaster should be declared. A universal disaster grant should come into immediate effect in recognition of the impact of the drought on food prices and the costs of securing water.&quot; A universal grant would be relatively simple and cost-effective to implement, given that South Africa already had an extensive social grant administration, Oxfam SA said.
