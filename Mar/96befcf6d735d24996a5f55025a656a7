South Africa&#39;s economy contracted quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of last year, weakened by underperformance in the mining and manufacturing sectors, Statistics South Africa said on Tuesday. Poor economic growth in South Africa has stymied revenue collection, and there is no major turnaround imminent with Treasury expecting growth of just 1.3% this year, well short of the government&#39;s target of 5% annual growth. The economy grew by 0.3% in 2016 compared with 1.3% in 2015, the agency said. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy is struggling to attract investment, with sentiment dimmed by infighting in the ruling party, weak growth that has hit consumer activity, as well as the looming threat of credit downgrades to junk. Gross domestic product fell by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 after expanding by a revised 0.4% in the third quarter, the agency said. The figure lagged the 0.5% growth anticipated by economist polled by Reuters. The mining sector fell 11.5% in the quarter, while manufacturing was down 3.1%. On year-on-year basis, the economy grew at 0.7%, unchanged from the previous quarter. South Africa faces the risk of being downgraded to junk status owing to the weak economic growth after it got a reprieve last year. S&amp;P and Fitch&rsquo;s ratings are both one level above junk status, Moody&rsquo;s two notches above. Moody&rsquo;s, which put South Africa on negative watch in its review, is due to revisit that on April 7, followed by S&amp;P at the beginning of June.
