State-owned power utility Eskom on Tuesday said that Kusile power station&rsquo;s Unit 1 had reached its full 800 MW load-generating capacity last week after the initial synchronisation on December 26. Kusile Unit 1, which is in the final stages of the combustion optimisation phase, is now one step closer to commercial operation. &ldquo;The construction and commissioning activities on the remaining Kusile Unit 2 to Unit 6 continue to progress uninterruptedly with the drive to early completion,&rdquo; Eskom said in an update on Tuesday. Ultimately, the 4 800 MW coal-fired station will comprise six units.
