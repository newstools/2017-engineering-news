The United National Transport Union (Untu) does not believe the newly appointed interim board of State-owned Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) will be able to save the entity. Transport Minister Dipuo Peters on Monday announced the appointment of the interim board, which will be chaired by former South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) CEO Nazir Alli, less than a week after the dissolving of the former board led by then-chairperson Popo Molefe. &ldquo;No newly appointed board member will have the guts or the insight in these circumstances to act in the best interest of PRASA&rsquo;s employees and of commuters,&rdquo; Untu general secretary Steve Harris said in a statement on Tuesday. &nbsp; Meanwhile, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) raised its concern over the appointment of the interim board. &ldquo;We believe the sudden purging of the recent board members will be a setback to the turnaround of this State-owned entity,&rdquo; said Outa transport portfolio director Ben Theron.
