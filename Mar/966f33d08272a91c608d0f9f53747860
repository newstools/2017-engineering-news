African Development Bank (AfDB) Southern Africa regional development and business delivery office director-general Tonia Kandiero and Zimbabwe Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa have signed a $4-million grant agreement to support a State-owned enterprise (SoE) reform and delivery project, in Zimbabwe. The project aims to build capacity with a view to strengthening the result-based management system within government and improve efficiency of SoEs and parastatals. &ldquo;Zimbabwe is committed to sound corporate governance and efforts to revive the country&rsquo;s economy through improved service delivery, with special focus on integrated results management,&rdquo; Kandiero said. She noted that, historically, SoEs were a significant source of employment, as well as productive investment with up to 40% contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. However, in recent years, their performance has dwindled, putting significant strain on the national budget. &ldquo;No profound change can take place in our member countries, including Zimbabwe, in the absence of effective institutions with good corporate structure, accountability, culture and mechanisms to track performance,&rdquo; she noted. Chinamasa, meanwhile, indicated that the project is in sync with the national economic blueprint, Zim-Asset, which falls under the public administration, governance and performance management subcluster. &ldquo;It also dovetails with the objective of the country&rsquo;s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy aimed at strengthening governance and institutional capacity for effective service delivery and combatting corruption,&rdquo; he said. The project will assist government in implementing reforms in public sector financial management and SoE governance. &nbsp;
