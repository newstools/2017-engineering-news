&quot;South Africa definitely has exploitable bio-energy potential,&quot; stated Council for Scientific and Industrial Research principal engineer Crescent Mushwana at the launch of the South Africa Bio-energy Atlas in Pretoria on Friday. &quot;Bio-energy is feasible from organic waste, residues from forestry and agriculture [lignocellulose], and eradication of alien invasive plants.&quot; These all amount to &#39;low-hanging fruits&#39;. &quot;The economic viability of biofuels from purposely cultivated crops is currently negatively affected by the low price of oil.&quot; However, most agricultural residues are already allocated to other uses, he cautioned, such as soil and nutrient regeneration. On the other hand, there is a lot that can be done in urban areas. &quot;Biomass potential is always closely correlated with population density,&quot; he highlighted. And areas of dense population tend to have good infrastructure, making it easier and cheaper to deploy biomass as an energy source. &quot;Organic waste is largely concentrated in big urban areas.&quot; Organic wastes are turned into biogas using simple devices called digesters. Basically, these are air-tight containers in which a biological process called anaerobic digestion takes place. Ideally, the temperature has to be controlled for optimal efficiency. The result is a mixture of methane (the major part) and carbon dioxide gas. The methane can be used as fuel to generate electricity. The residues can be used as fertiliser. &quot;Organic waste looks like a [low-cost] winner in all cases.&quot; &quot;Lignocellulose is a very important factor we should look at,&quot; he points out. &quot;In the short term there is potential for what can be done with existing operations.&quot; This could include co-located electricity generation at sawmills and sugar mills. &quot;Compared to renewable energy programmes, there is space for these [bio-energy] technologies to play. Definitely for lignocellulose and biogas from digesters,&quot; assures Mushwana. These two technologies are both cost-competitive. &quot;Definitely, there is potential.&quot; The goal of the atlas is to act as a &quot;decision support tool&quot; to help the government in planning, investment and deployment decisions regarding bio-energy technologies, for heating, transport fuels as well as power generation.
