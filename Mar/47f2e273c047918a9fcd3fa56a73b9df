The South African Renewable Energy Council (Sarec) on Wednesday urged South Africans to participate in the public comment process on South Africa&rsquo;s Integrated Resources Plan 2016 (IRP2016) update report, which closes on March 31. It noted that the public participation process is an &ldquo;ideal opportunity&rdquo; for citizens to sway the long-term investment choices that will serve the country up to 2050. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t often have an opportunity to influence government policy, so this is a significant moment, not just for the energy industry, but for all South Africans,&rdquo; Sarec chairperson Brenda Martin said. The council further noted that the plan was three years overdue &ndash; &ldquo;a significant period considering that energy technology changes at a rapid rate&rdquo; &ndash; adding that, while the IRP2010 was last updated in 2013, that report was never confirmed. &ldquo;The country has been working with an outdated energy plan for far too long. &ldquo;The general public have become well informed as to the long-term implications of various power supply options and are thus well-placed to influence the energy investment choice pathways up to mid-century,&rdquo; added Martin. In its submission to the Department of Energy, Sarec indicates that the IRP process should be a purely techno-economic exercise providing rational input into the policy debate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 2016 update process itself has detracted from the valuable capacity of the IRP modelling tool to identify the cost-optimal build and technology mix for the South African economy; this mix could result in electricity price competitiveness and tariff affordability,&rdquo; stated Martin. Sarec believes renewable energy can play a significant role in the re-industrialisation of the country, transitioning away from the carbon-based minerals energy complex towards a more sustainable future.
