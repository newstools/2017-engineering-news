Ford Motor Company is exploring how large one-piece automotive parts, like car spoilers, can be printed for prototyping and future production vehicles. Ford is the first automaker to pilot the Stratasys Infinite Build three-dimensional (3D) printer. &nbsp; Capable of printing car parts of practically any shape or length, the Stratasys Infinite Build system could be a breakthrough for vehicle manufacturing, providing a more efficient and affordable way to produce tooling, or prototype parts or components at low volumes, for Ford Performance vehicles, or for personalised car parts. &nbsp; &ldquo;With the Infinite Build technology, we are now able to print large tools, fixtures and components, making us nimbler in design iterations,&rdquo; says Ford technical leader for additive manufacturing research Ellen Lee. The new 3D print system is located at Ford&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Center, in Dearborn, Michigan, in the US. &nbsp;&nbsp; In future, 3D printing could have immense benefits for automotive production, including the ability to produce lighter-weight parts, which may help improve fuel efficiency. A 3D-printed spoiler, for instance, may weigh less than half of its metal-cast equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, 3D printing is a more cost-efficient way to produce parts only needed at low volumes, like prototypes and specialised parts for race cars. &ldquo;Ford also may use the technology to make larger printed tooling and fixtures, as well as personalised components for customers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; Specifications for the part are transferred from the computer-aided design programme to the printer&rsquo;s computer, which analyses the design. The device then goes to work, printing one layer of material at a time &ndash; in this case, plastic &ndash; and then gradually stacking the layers into a finished 3D object.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;When the system detects that the raw material or supply material canister is empty, a robotic arm automatically replaces it with a full canister. This allows the printer to operate for hours or days while unattended,&rdquo; Lee said.&nbsp; &nbsp;
