State-owned Eskom has energised and commissioned the second 500 MVA power transformer at the newly built Ngwedi substation, in Rustenburg, North West, bringing the total transformer capacity to 1 000 MVA. This will provide improved flexibility and reliability of the network in South Africa&rsquo;s platinum belt in the greater Rustenburg area. &ldquo;Ngwedi substation is required to provide for the expected load growth because of the developments in platinum mining operations taking place in the Rustenburg area, which, at present, cannot be supplied by the existing transmission and distribution networks,&rdquo; Eskom group capital executive Abram Masango says. This commissioning of the second transformer also marks a significant step towards the completion of the Medupi power station integration project, which is aimed at supporting the grid system between Limpopo and North West. Phase 2 of the power station integration project comprises the construction of two substations &ndash; Ngwedi, and Borutho, in Limpopo, as well as the construction of transmission lines from the Medupi power station to both substations. The first of the two transformers to be installed at Ngwedi substation was commissioned in December 2016.
