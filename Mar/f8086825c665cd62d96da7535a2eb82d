President Jacob Zuma ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to return from an investor roadshow to Britain and the US on Monday because he &quot;did not give permission for the trip&quot;, a government source said. Appointed in late 2015 after a predecessor&#39;s sudden sacking, Gordhan was in London for the first leg of a week-long non-deal investor roadshow in Britain and the United States. Weak economic growth and tensions within the ruling party African National Congress (ANC) have put South Africa&#39;s investment grade credit rating at risk. The rand fell as much as 1.7% following the report, while bonds weakened sharply. Banking shares on the Johannesburg bourse fell more than 2 percent. &quot;They were told last night or this morning to come back... the presidency did not give permission for the trip,&quot; the government source said. The president&#39;s office could not be reached for comment. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy escaped being downgraded to junk status last year. S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings both rank the sovereign one level above junk, while Moody&#39;s puts it two notches higher. Moody&#39;s, which put South Africa on negative watch in its latest review, is due to revisit that on April 7, followed by S&amp;P at the beginning of June. Gordhan&#39;s team on the trip to London, Boston and New York included deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas and Treasury director general Lungisa Fuzile, as well as business executives and union leaders.
