South African President Jacob Zuma&#39;s decision to dismiss Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has severe consequences for the economy and is a setback to the work done to avoid a credit ratings downgrade, a group of business leaders said on Friday. &quot;This decision, and the manner in which it was taken, is likely to cause severe damage to an economy that is in dire need of growth and jobs,&quot; said the CEO Initiative, an organisation that includes the chief executives of Nedbank, Standard Bank, the JSE and Investec.
