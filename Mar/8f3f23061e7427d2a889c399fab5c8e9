The Department of Trade and industry (DTI) on Thursday said it was &ldquo;pleased&rdquo; with the progress being made in developing South Africa&rsquo;s mining equipment manufacturing sector under the umbrella of Mining Equipment Manufacturers of South Africa (Memsa). The department launched the initiative to bring together the country&rsquo;s leading manufacturers and rebuild the global competitiveness of the sector after a 2014 research review recommended the establishment of a cluster for manufacturers to collaborate as an organised group in offering their products and services to the underground mining industry. &ldquo;As a department, we are pleased that we are making noticeable strides and commendable progress in our efforts to recreate an export-oriented South African mining equipment manufacturing sector, which is capable of meeting local demand and supplying key export markets,&rdquo; said Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies in a statement. &ldquo;We will continue to work until the majority of the estimated 100 local manufacturers of capital goods, subassembled units, components and wear parts to the mining industry have come on board,&rdquo; the Minister assured, pointing out that, to date, only 23 companies were currently committed to Memsa. Further, the DTI enlisted Memsa as a pilot project for its Cluster Development Programme (CDP) incentive programme. &ldquo;Through the CDP, the DTI will provide the mining equipment manufacturers with funding for their research and development initiatives, technology improvement, export market identification and penetration, skills development and supply chain upgrading, among others,&rdquo; Davies concluded.
