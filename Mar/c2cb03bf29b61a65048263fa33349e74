PERTH (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified major Rio Tinto has confirmed that chairperson Jan du Plessis will retire after the completion of an &quot;orderly succession process&quot;. British multinational group BT Group announced earlier on Thursday that Du Plessis would join its board as a nonexecutive director on June 1, and as chairperson on November 1. He will succeed outgoing BT Group chairperson Sir Mike Rake. Rio on Thursday said it had initiated a succession plan to appoint a new chairperson in June 2016, after the appointment of Jean Sebastian Jacques as CEO. A successor to Du Plessis will likely be announced before the end of 2017, with Du Plessis expected to retire no later than the 2018 annual general meeting. &ldquo;When we announced the appointment of Jacques as CEO a year ago, I committed to the board to serve as chairperson for another two years, as part of a planned leadership transition. Today&rsquo;s announcement is the next step in that plan. I remain committed to leading the board until I stand down, supporting the management team and ensuring an orderly handover to my successor,&rdquo; said Du Plessis.
