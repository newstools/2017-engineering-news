Swiss-French cement maker LafargeHolcim should think twice about supplying cement for the wall US President Donald Trump plans to build on the border with Mexico, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on Thursday. Trump&#39;s plan has caused a diplomatic crisis with Mexico, and in an interview with Agence France Presse earlier this week, LafargeHolcim chief executive Eric Olsen said he was prepared to supply the materials for it. Officials at LafargeHolcim could not be immediately reached for comments regarding Ayrault&#39;s remarks. &quot;It (Lafarge) should reflect upon what its interests are. There are other clients who will be stunned by this,&quot; Ayrault said on France Info radio. &quot;Lafarge says it doesn&#39;t do politics . . . Very well, but I would say companies . . . also have social and environmental responsibilities.&quot; Olsen was quoted as saying in his AFP interview: &quot;We are the number-one cement group in the United States . . . we are here to support the construction and development of the country . . . We are not a political organisation.&quot; LafargeHolcim last week acknowledged that one of its cement plants probably paid protection money to armed groups in Syria to keep the factory running, calling the payments reported by media &quot;unacceptable&quot; in hindsight.
