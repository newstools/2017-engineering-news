Eskom on Thursday signed a five-year firm electricity sales agreement with Namibia&rsquo;s national electricity utility NamPower, providing energy security to the neighbouring country and facilitating economic development and growth. Eskom interim CEO Matshela Koko noted at the signing, held alongside the forty-second Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) executive committee meeting in Maseru, Lesotho, that the agreement stemmed from Eskom&rsquo;s surplus capacity, stating that the company was &ldquo;now open for business&rdquo;. He added that it was &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; that the Southern African region was still struggling to provide access to electricity to its citizens and to power their industries and mines, which stunted economic growth. &ldquo;The challenge now is to focus on strengthening the transmission interconnection between the various countries to allow the sharing of the available power. We stand ready to supply electricity to the region,&rdquo; said Koko. Eskom intends to conclude agreements with other SAPP members, including Lesotho and Swaziland, before the end of the month.
