A $350-million deal to finance an 80 MW peat-to-power project in Rwanda, which will improve access to electricity for the three-quarters of the country&rsquo;s population that is currently off the grid, has reached financial close.&nbsp; &nbsp; The power plant, which is expected to increase installed capacity in Rwanda by 40%, will use the country&rsquo;s significant peat reserves to improve the national installed generation capacity. Despite its status as one of Africa&rsquo;s fastest-growing economies, only 25% of Rwanda&rsquo;s population has access to reliable electricity. &nbsp; The plant is being built in the Mamba sector of Gisagara district, one of the most remote areas in Rwanda, and is expected to be completed within three years. &nbsp; Multilateral development finance institution Africa Finance Corporation is the mandated lead arranger for the project debt, and has successfully arranged total senior debt facilities of $245-million, contributing $75-million in loans and providing an underwriting commitment of $35-million. &nbsp; Finnish development finance company Finnfund served as the lead arranger for total mezzanine debt facilities of $35-million for the project. The other lenders are Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank, African Export-Import Bank,&nbsp;Export-Import Bank of India and Rwanda Development Bank. &nbsp; Rwanda aims to provide 70% of its 12-million people with power from the grid or off-grid, by 2018, and the country intends to become a lower middle-income country by 2020.
