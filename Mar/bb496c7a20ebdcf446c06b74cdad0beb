The South African Revenue Service has granted Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) new depot licences for all its multipurpose terminals (MPTs) for the packing and unpacking of containers for all commodities, including agri, mineral and mining bulk products. This enables State-owned TPT to efficiently facilitate the needs of new and existing customers by adding value to their commodity supply chain and growing its revenue stream amid depreciating commodity volumes. &ldquo;TPT will offer a consolidated solution to our customers offering them a cost-effective one-stop value-add service,&rdquo; said TPT new business development GM Brenda Magqwaka. The new service, offered at all seven MPTs at Durban Point, Durban Maydon Wharf, East London, Richards Bay, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Saldanha, was a &ldquo;welcome intervention&rdquo;, not just for junior miners but also for well-established businesses, she added. &ldquo;TPT&rsquo;s national customer service centre is geared to support customers who wish to take full advantage of the services on offer,&rdquo; Magqwaka concluded.
