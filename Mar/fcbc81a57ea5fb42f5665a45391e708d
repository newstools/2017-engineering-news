The Communications Department on Thursday said that the demand for government subsidised set-top-boxes was on the rise. &ldquo;It is encouraging to see the growth in demand. The increase in registrations is a strong indication of the success of the migration project,&rdquo; said Communications Minister Faith Muthambi. &ldquo;Awareness is growing day by day and people appreciate the tangible benefits that come with this process.&rdquo; The Department said in February 36 042 households registered for these decoders, compared to 11 709 in January. The Northern Cape and Free State provinces have already gone through a set-top-box installation phase. &ldquo;This month the installation of set-top-boxes will resume in other borderline provinces such as Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal,&rdquo; said the minister. The department said 18 analogue transmitters had been switched-off since October last year in the area surrounding the Square Kilometre Array in the Northern Cape. &ldquo;Digital terrestrial television services provide us with a rich opportunity to realise the vision of building a people-centred and inclusive information society,&rdquo; said Muthambi.
