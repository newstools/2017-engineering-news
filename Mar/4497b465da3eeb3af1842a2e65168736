The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa), which will hold its yearly Awards for Excellence in May, will honour those companies that have upheld high health and safety performances in 2016. &nbsp; Seifsa CEO Kaizer Nyatsumba says that, although the metals and engineering sector was faced with many challenges and uncertainties in 2016, there were companies that still managed to excel under these difficult circumstances, while ensuring the health and safety of workers. &nbsp; &ldquo;Even during tight budgets, which are the norm during an economic crisis, health and safety are still a significant part of the workplace and remain important legal obligations, with companies required to comply regardless of the prevailing circumstances. Failing to comply can lead to company directors being held legally liable for irregularities in health and safety,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; Entries for the Seifsa Awards for Excellence will close on April 13 and Nyatsumba encourages manufacturers operating in the metals and engineering sector to submit their entries for the seven categories as soon as possible. Entrants in the health and safety category will be assessed on their performance between January 1 and December 31, 2016.
