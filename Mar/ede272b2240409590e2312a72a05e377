The Competition Commission on Friday extended its search and seizure operation targeting fresh produce market agents, to premises in Cape Town and Durban. This followed its raid, on Thursday, of the premises of nine fresh produce market agents suspected of involvement in alleged cartel and price-fixing conduct in contravention of the Competition Act at the Tshwane Market, in Pretoria, and the Joburg Market, in Johannesburg. In Cape Town, the commission raided the premises of Subtropico; RSA Group; and Fine Bros. In Durban, the commission executed a search and seizure warrant at the premises of RSA Group; Wenpro KZN and Delta Market Agents. The commission on Thursday said it has reasonable grounds to believe that the agents entered into an agreement and/or engaged in a concerted practice to fix the price and trading conditions for the supply of freshly produced fruit and vegetables in South Africa.
