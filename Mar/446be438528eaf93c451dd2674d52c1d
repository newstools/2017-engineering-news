Bereaved families tussled with rescue workers on Tuesday at the site of an Ethiopian rubbish dump where a landslide killed 65 people this weekend. Relatives pushed and shoved the handful of emergency workers, angrily accusing them of delays and saying dozens of people were still missing after Saturday&#39;s disaster at the Reppi dump in the capital of Addis Ababa. &quot;Nobody is helping us. We are doing all the digging ourselves. It is shameful,&quot; Kaleab Tsegaye, a relative of one victim told Reuters.
