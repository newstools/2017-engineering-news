State-owned Eskom has electrified over 40 000 households in KwaZulu-Natal between April 2016 and February this year, including more than 13 000 connections in the uMkhanyakude district. &ldquo;With this achievement, the historic label of KwaZulu-Natal being one of the least electrified provinces is slowly but surely disappearing and changing for the better,&rdquo; Eskom Distribution group executive Mongezi Ntsokolo said. Over 90% of South African households currently have access to electricity, with the parastatal aspiring to achieve universal access by 2020. The National Treasury has allocated R1-billion for the electrification of over 800 000 households over the next three years to help reach this target.
