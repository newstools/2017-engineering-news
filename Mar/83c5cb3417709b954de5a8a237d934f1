The South African Energy and Metallurgical Cluster has entered its implementation phase, following the signing of a R40-billion operator agreement between the State-owned Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (SEZ), where the cluster resides, and the Shenzhen Hoi Mor Resources Holding Company. Shenzhen will develop, operate and manage the South African Energy and Metallurgical Cluster, aimed at producing high-grade steel for the domestic and export market, and is also the anchor investor in the zone. The facilities will include power infrastructure, as well as coking coal, ferrochrome, pig iron, steel, stainless steel and lime plants, and supporting facilities. Speaking at the signing, Musina-Makhado SEZ chairperson Tshepo Phetla said he was looking forward to having the spin-offs of this agreement stimulating the . . . economic growth of the region of Vhembe and the province at large. &ldquo;The whole concept of industrialisation steers us on a right trajectory to try and industrialise the province. This is one project that I believe will revolutionalise the province in terms of its quest to industrialise. We believe this partnership with Shenzhen will take us far and will create 22 000 direct jobs,&rdquo; said Phetla.
