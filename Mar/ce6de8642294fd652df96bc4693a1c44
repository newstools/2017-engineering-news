A PhD candidate at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU), Keith Nare, has been appointed South African National Roads Agency Limited&rsquo;s (Sanral&rsquo;s) first ever research associate at the entity&rsquo;s materials lab in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape. Nare&rsquo;s role at the lab is to perform a role linking academia and the industry, with his responsibilities spanning internal research on bituminous binders to the implementation of the South African performance grade bitumen specifications. &nbsp;&nbsp; Sanral Southern Region materials specialist Sean Strydom pointed out that Nare&rsquo;s position at Sanral involves rheological testing, which is a highly specialised testing method using high-end testing equipment of which just a handful exist in the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;The training of persons who operate Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) [equipment] is done by the international suppliers of the equipment.&nbsp; We were lucky that Nare, during his studies, had already received in-depth training in the use of the testing equipment,&rdquo; Strydom noted. The test data Nare is generating are expected to assist Sanral in ensuring that the entity&rsquo;s new performance specification of bitumen is best suited to South African road conditions. The data is being generated by testing bitumen samples from Sanral&rsquo;s construction sites across the Eastern Cape.
