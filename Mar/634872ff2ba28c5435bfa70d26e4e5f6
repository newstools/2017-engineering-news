President Jacob Zuma will launch the seventeenth edition of the United Nations (UN) World Water Development report, focusing on the critical role of wastewater management for vibrant economies, resilient societies and the maintenance of healthy environments, at the World Water Day Summit, in Durban, later this month. Zuma will also, in his capacity as the chairperson of the Heads of State Committee on the UN high level panel on water, present a declaratory statement on roll-out activities of the high-level panel on water at domestic, regional and global level. The summit, hosted by the Department of Water and Sanitation in partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government and UN Water, will further showcase the progress made by South Africa in meeting its water and sanitation goals since 1994, while enabling knowledge sharing and experiences on risks in water provision induced by drought and climate change.
