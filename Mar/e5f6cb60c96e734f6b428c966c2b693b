The European Commission said on Friday it regretted a US decision to impose antidumping measures on steel plate exported from Europe, adding that the duties were &quot;artificially inflated&quot;. The US Department of Commerce set duties of up to 148 percent on cut-to-length plate from seven producers from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, prompting Germany to urge the EU to file a WTO complaint. The Commission had been active during the procedure supporting the European exporters concerned, a spokesman said. &quot;Unfortunately, our comments and notably those concerning the use by the US of methodologies which artificially inflate the preliminary dumping margins have not been given expected consideration,&quot; the spokesman said. The final duties were in many cases higher than the preliminary duties set in November. &quot;We will look now into the detail of the decision taken by the US and consider the appropriate steps,&quot; he continued.
