The Competition Commission has approved the sale of Murray and Roberts&rsquo; (M&amp;R&rsquo;s) infrastructure and building (I&amp;B) platform to Firefly Investments 319, without conditions. M&amp;R has undergone a significant restructuring in recent years that will result in it exiting the general building and civil engineering sector to become a project company focused on the oil and gas, underground mining, power and water sectors. Firefly is a newly established firm created for the purposes of the proposed transaction and currently does not have any business operations. The I&amp;B platform operations are involved in civil engineering, general building and road and earthworks, opencast mining, main civil works for power station, construction plant and equipment and property development. &ldquo;The proposed transaction is unlikely to substantially prevent or lessen competition and does not raise any public interest concerns,&rdquo; the commission said in a statement.
