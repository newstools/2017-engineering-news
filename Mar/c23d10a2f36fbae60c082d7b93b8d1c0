South Africa&#39;s outgoing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday an intelligence report President Jacob Zuma used as justification to fire him was &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;. Gordhan also said during a televised press conference in Pretoria on Friday that he had been &quot;sickened&quot; by allegations that he had secret meetings to undermine the government during an investor roadshow abroad.
