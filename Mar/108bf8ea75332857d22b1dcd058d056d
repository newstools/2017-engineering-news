Ford South Africa on Monday said more than 63% of the 1.6-litre Ford Kuga&rsquo;s that were recalled have been repaired and returned to their owners. Around 4 556 1.6-litre Ford Kugas, built between December 2012 and February 2014, have been affected by the safety recall in South Africa. Ford noted, however, that many of the affected vehicles had not yet been brought in to Ford dealers for the required repairs and urged all customers who had not yet participated in the recall to do so as a priority. &quot;Our dealers are working tirelessly replacing parts, testing and verifying the integrity of the cooling system, ensuring the latest software updates are applied and getting customers back into their vehicles,&quot; Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa CEO Jeff Nemeth said in a statement. He highlights that, once this first stage of the safety recall is completed, and with proper maintenance of the cooling system, the 1.6-litre Kuga is safe to drive. Ford confirmed that there have been no reports of any Kuga vehicles catching fire since the recall was announced in January.
