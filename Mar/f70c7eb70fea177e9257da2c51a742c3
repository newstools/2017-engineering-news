A total of 3 600 government officials were found guilty of misconduct through information received through the National Anti-Corruption Hotline (NACH), resulting in the recovery of more than R400-million from guilty parties between 1 September 2004 and 31 January 2017, a statement from the governance and administration cluster of ministers said on Thursday. However, according to the statement which was read out during a media briefing in Parliament, less than half of the guilty officials were dismissed. Of the 3 600 disciplined for misconduct, 1 700 officials were dismissed from the public service, 447 officials were fined, many by not receiving three months&rsquo; salary, 137 officials were demoted, 921 officials were given final written warnings, and 395 officials were prosecuted. &ldquo;The successful investigation of cases of alleged corruption reported to the NACH resulted in the recovery of R410-million from perpetrators,&rdquo; according to the cluster. &ldquo;It is, therefore, evident that the NACH has yielded positive results, not only in terms of monetary value, but also in terms of disciplinary action taken against perpetrators.&rdquo; The Public Service Commission (PSC), on behalf of government, manages the NACH which people can access by dialling 0800 701 701. &ldquo;Whistle blowers can call the NACH to report corruption without fear of victimisation as the Hotline offers anonymity,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;As at 31 January 2017, 18 778 cases were referred to government departments, and feedback on 17 240 (92%) cases was received. Of the total number of cases referred, 16 947 (90%) cases were closed.&rdquo; The rate of financial disclosures among senior public servants had also increased to 98% &ndash; the biggest leap yet since the Financial Disclosure Framework was introduced. &ldquo;This is an increase of 16% in the submission rate as compared to 82% recorded during the previous financial year (2014/2015).&rdquo; The disclosure system would now also include &ldquo;middle managers, employees in the supply chain management and those working in finance units, ethics officers as well as employees of the Office of the Public Service Commission who verify financial interests disclosed by Senior Management Services members&rdquo; who would have to fill in disclosure forms every year between April 1 to 30.
