Food and fisheries company Premier Food and Fishing&nbsp;on Thursday listed in the Farming, Fishing and Plantations sector of the JSE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Being listed on the JSE will allow us to give our employees, as well as the members of the communities in which we operate, an opportunity to acquire equity in the company and thereby a liquid, tradeable asset within a regulated environment,&rdquo; CEO Samier Saban said in a statement. &nbsp; He added that the company is committed to the ongoing sustainability of marine life and is a member of the South African Fishing Ethically Association. &ldquo;Our involvement in abalone farming contributes to the sustainability of this species in South African waters, and our overall underlying ethic of farming for the future,&rdquo; Saban noted. He pointed out that Premier Food and Fishing is well positioned for growth over the next three years and into the future. &ldquo;As one of the largest black-owned fishing companies in South Africa, and given that current legislation is likely to promote black participation and development in this area, this should be beneficial for growth in this sector, which, in turn, is expected to assist with job creation and community upliftment.&quot; &nbsp;
