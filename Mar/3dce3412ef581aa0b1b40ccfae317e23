Group Five has appointed Themba Mosai interim CEO, while it seeks a successor to former CEO Eric Vemer. Vemer last week announced his surprise resignation from the group after less than three years in the position. The Group Five board has initiated processes for the appointment of a permanent CEO, which include the assessment of both internal and external potential candidates. Mosai, who is a Group Five executive committee member and the head of its Developments business, has been with the group for nearly 13 years. He has previously also worked for AngloGold Ashanti and Lebone Consulting Engineers.
