State-owned Eskom has lodged papers in the High Court against the Democratic Alliance (DA) for wrongful and defamatory actions by the party against the company and its interim CEO Matshela Koko, the entity said on Wednesday. &nbsp; The DA published an article on its website in late January titled, &ldquo;DA to PAIA R27-million Eskom report&quot;, which stated that the so-called Dentons report into operational and financial underperformance at Eskom contains information on widespread corruption within the top ranks of the entity and that its findings include extensive corruption implicating the now acting CEO. PAIA stands for Promotion of Access to Information Act. Koko on Wednesday said Eskom was seeking the court&rsquo;s protection from abuse of power, cheap politicking and public grandstanding. &ldquo;Our position on the Dentons report is a matter of public record and we are open to engage political parties in Parliament as required by the law.&rdquo; &nbsp; The DA has given notice of their intent to defend themselves against the action. &nbsp;
