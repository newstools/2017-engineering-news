Africa&#39;s biggest mobile phone operator MTN Group swung into a hefty $108-million annual loss on Thursday, its first in two decades, hit by a regulatory fine in Nigeria and unfavourable currency moves. MTN said its headline loss came in at R1.4-billion ($108-million), or 77c a share, in the year to end-December compared with headline earnings of R13.6-billion, or 746c a share, a year earlier. MTN agreed to pay a fine of 330-billion naira ($1.1-billion), reduced from $5.2-billion, in June last year after a prolonged legal battle to end a dispute in Nigeria over missing a deadline to cut off unregistered SIM cards. The company said the fine wiped R10.5-billion ($768-million) &ndash; 500c a share &ndash; from headline earnings, South Africa&#39;s main measure of profit. Africa&#39;s most populous nation and biggest economy, Nigeria, is MTN&#39;s most lucrative but increasingly problematic market. MTN is under investigation by Nigerian lawmakers for allegedly illegally repatriating $14-billion between 2006 and 2016, the second major dispute analysts have said exposes the inherent risk of investing in frontier markets. MTN has denied any wrongdoing. Founded with Pretoria&#39;s help after the end of white rule in 1994, MTN is seen as one of post-apartheid South Africa&#39;s biggest commercial successes but clashes with regulators in recent years have exposed governance issues and hobbled growth.
