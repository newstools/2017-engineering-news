Mali&rsquo;s first utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant, the 33 MW Segou project, which will be built at a cost of $25-million. The project will increase the country&sup1;s installed capacity from renewable resources and will generate 52.7 GWh/y, or about 10% of current generation capacity, over 25 years. The project will be funded under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries funding window of The Climate Investment Funds, with co-financing from the AfDB and International Finance Corporation. Each is contributing $8.4-million. The project will be implemented by a special purpose vehicle that is fully owned by the private sector under a 25-year build, own, operate and transfer concession agreement with the government of Mali and a 25-year power purchase agreement with Mali&sup1;s national utility, &Eacute;nergie du Mali. &ldquo;Introducing utility-scale solar PV as an energy source will enable Mali to harness its abundant solar energy potential, diversify the country&rsquo;s energy mix and increase access to cleaner energy for its citizens,&rdquo; said AfDB climate change and green growth director Anthony Nyong.
