Turkey has launched a complaint at the World Trade Organization to challenge US anti-subsidy duties on Turkish pipe and tube products, the WTO said on Wednesday. The products include oil country tubular goods, welded line pipe, heavy walled rectangular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes and circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes, a WTO statement said. Under WTO rules, the United States has 60 days to settle the dispute. After that period Turkey could ask the WTO to adjudicate. The WTO did not immediately have detailed information on the complaint.
