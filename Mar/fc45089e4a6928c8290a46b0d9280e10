South Africa&rsquo;s third-largest mobile operator Cell C on Tuesday posted a profit for the first time of R540-million for the year ended December 31, a reverse on the loss of R5.6-billion recorded in the prior financial year. The growth was attributed in bulk to foreign exchange-related gains stemming from the group&rsquo;s recapitalisation plan, which has seen a portion of and will ultimately see all foreign debt eliminated, opening room for growth, CEO Jose Dos Santos commented during a presentation of the financial performance. The recapitalisation plan, which is expected to reach completion at the end of May or early in June, will see Cell C&rsquo;s debt reduce from R20-billion in mixed currencies to R6-billion in local debt. This will also result in Blue Label holding a 45% stake in Cell C, Net 1 Applied Technologies holding 15% and Cell C executives 5%, while empowerment partner CellSAf will maintain its shareholding through 3C Communications. Staff will also participate and the company&rsquo;s historically disadvantaged individual ownership credentials will increase from 25% to 30%. Meanwhile, Cell C&rsquo;s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the 2016 financial year increased by 59% year-on-year to R3.1-billion. The Ebitda margin increased from 15% in 2015 to 21% in 2016, through a combination of increased revenue and cost management initiatives. Revenue was up 11% to R14.6-billion and service revenue increased 8% to R11.8-billion for the 12 months to December. Cell C&rsquo;s subscriber base grew 20% year-on-year from 12.8-million in 2015 to 15.3-million in 2016, with data growth up 67% and data revenue having increased by 35%. Data revenue now makes up 37% of service revenue, up from 30% a year ago. Voice revenue declined 2% and wholesale revenue increased 147% to R370-million during the year under review. &ldquo;We are in a healthy space,&rdquo; Dos Santos commented. Cell C invested R3.37-billion in capital expenditure (capex) during 2016, taking total capex invested since 2013 to R11.6-billion. The operator now has around 5 000 sites &ndash; 2 500 of which are long-term evolution (LTE) sites and more than 2 000 that are LTE-Advanced.
