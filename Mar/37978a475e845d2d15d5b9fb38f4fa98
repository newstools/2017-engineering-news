French development financier Agence Fran&ccedil;aise de D&eacute;veloppement (AFD) expects to disburse &euro;1.3-billion in funding support to South African projects in the coming five years as part of a newly approved operational strategy for the country. AFD says the funding will take the form of nonsovereign loans, grants for capacity building and technical assistance, as well as guarantees. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve committed more than &euro;2.3-billion in loans since we started operations in South Africa in 1994 with 44% dedicated to improvement in access to basic services and 55% dedicated to the fight against climate change,&rdquo; regional director in Southern Africa Martha Stein-Sochas said in a statement. For the period 2017 to 2020, AFD will target projects with a high social impact, including those focusing on inclusive urban development, South Africa&rsquo;s energy transition and/or providing disadvantaged youth with access to higher education and vocational training.
