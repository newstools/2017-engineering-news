The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) on Wednesday welcomed the easing in consumer price inflation to 6.3% in February, down from 6.6% in January. Contributors to easing inflation included food and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as household contents and services.&nbsp; Seifsa chief economist Tafadzwa Chibanguza said the strengthening rand had a positive impact on inflation and on the inflation outlook. &ldquo;The rand is actually doing a lot of work for the Monetary Policy Committee of the South African Reserve Bank, which meets next week to decide on the next rate move,&rdquo; he said. Chibanguza added that the February consumer price index reading, together with the current level of the rand, measuring R12.65 to the dollar, presented a case for rates to remain on hold next week. Seifsa&rsquo;s view was further supported by the core inflation reading, which excludes food, nonalcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, which was recorded at 5.2% year-on-year in February. The reading is down from the December 2016 and January 2017 year-on-year readings of 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively. &ldquo;Easing inflation translates favourably to consumer balance sheets, hence the February 2017 reading is definitely a welcome move,&rdquo; Chibanguza noted.
