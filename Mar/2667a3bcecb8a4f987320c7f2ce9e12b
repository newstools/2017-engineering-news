Valves and related solutions manufacturer AVK Holding Southern Africa has bolstered its manufacturing footprint and product offering after acquiring a 100% interest in Gunric Valves, including all brand assets and intellectual property (IP) for an undisclosed amount. The deal would provide AVK access to Gunric&rsquo;s specialisation in the manufacture and export of large diameter and made-to-order butterfly valves, tilting disc check valves and triple offset metal seated butterfly valves. &nbsp; &ldquo;The addition of the triple offset metal seated butterfly valves product programme strengthens our offering to our core water business, as well as enables us to extend our industrial valves offering to customers,&rdquo; said AVK Southern Africa director Patrick Jantjies in a statement on Monday. &ldquo;This is an exciting addition to our ever-growing product programme &ndash; one that will also fortify our offering for both South African and international project business,&rdquo; he said of the opportunity that boosted the company&rsquo;s manufacturing and technical support in Southern Africa. &nbsp; AVK will continue to operate at the existing facility at Robertville, in Gauteng, and will work closely with the team at the Robertville facility to expand and strengthen the overall position of the group in the Southern African and global markets. &nbsp;
