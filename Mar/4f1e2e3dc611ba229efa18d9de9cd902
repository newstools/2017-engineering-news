A section of the roof at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, in Parktown, Johannesburg, collapsed on Thursday afternoon while construction work to repair leaks was ongoing, trapping some workers and patients. Arnold Malotana, chief director of emergency medical services (EMS) at Gauteng Department of Health, told African News Agency (ANA) that the section of the roof near the main entrance collapsed during repairs to fix it. &ldquo;The contractors were busy with roof repairs on that section of the hospital today when the roof caved in,&rdquo; Malotana said. &ldquo;It is suspected that some contractors and three patients are currently trapped under the rubble, and no one has been found yet.&rdquo; Various paramedics were on the scene to attend to the injured and the area had been cordoned off for investigation. According to Johannesburg EMS spokesperson, Nana Radebe, one person was removed from the rubble and taken to a nearby hospital for medical attention. Gauteng Department of Health issued a statement saying the roof collapse took place in a passage near the maternity department on the Hospital Street side. Democratic Alliance (DA) spokesperson on health in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, said the entire hospital must be urgently assessed to ensure it is safe. Bloom said he had raised the issue of structural defects on the building&rsquo;s fifth floor before, which according to him, required R50 million worth of urgent repairs. &ldquo;Staff have told me that stones were moved onto the section of the roof which collapse onto the hospital street level,&rdquo; Bloom said. &ldquo;Staff at the Hospital have warned in the past of the leaking Hospital roofs and other structural problems in the building.&rdquo;
