Fleet management, vehicle tracking and telematics technology management company Cartrack officially reached over 600&nbsp;000 active subscribers globally in February. The figure reflects strong, consistent growth over the past year, and a 20% year-on-year increase in subscriber numbers. &ldquo;An increase in active subscribers translates into further growth in annuity revenues and is a key determinant in our ability to grow our base globally,&rdquo; chief sales officer Juan Marais said on Tuesday. He added that the company invested heavily in research and development and distribution channels, which has&nbsp; translated into robust growth. &ldquo;We are part of an underpenetrated and high-growth industry and see ourselves as still in a growth phase across all continents. The expectation is that this growth trend will continue.&rdquo; &nbsp; The robust subscriber growth was driven by strong performances in Asia, Europe and South Africa. The South African market is differentiated by the stolen vehicle recovery service that is provided, a sector in which Cartrack has performed consistently well. Cartrack has maintained a recovery rate of around 94%. &ldquo;This is partly as a result of having an in-house recovery team, which allows greater control of deployment and service levels. In addition, Cartrack offers a pay-out of up to R150 000, in the unlikely event that they cannot recover a vehicle,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; Marais added that the introduction of electronic driver logging legislation for long-haul vehicles in the US, where the company has an office, was creating substantial growth opportunities for fleet management technology. &ldquo;Ultimately, expanding our operations internationally, as well as ensuring the continued provision of innovative and reliable services and technology remains our commitment,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; &nbsp;
