Angola&#39;s State-run Sonangol has taken two cargoes out of its planned May exports in a move to boost its compliance with an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) deal to curb production, an oil trader familiar with Angolan loading plans said on Monday. A revised loading programme showed the country&#39;s exports were now set at 1.61-million barrels a day from 52 cargoes, down from 1.67-million barrels a day from 54 cargoes initially. The source said the two cargo loadings removed and pushed into June were an end-month Dalia that was with Sonangol and a Cabinda that was set to load with ENI. Under the deal with the Opec and other nations, Angola agreed to cut 78 000 bbl/d from a reference production level of 1.751-million barrels a day. So far this year, Angola&#39;s production and exports have been well below the target but several fields are coming into production or ramping up, including Chevron&#39;s Mafumeira Sul and Eni&#39;s West Hub and East Hub projects.
