The Chevron operated Mafumeira Sul field in Angola began oil production in October 2016 and will start supplying gas for export in the second quarter of this year, state energy firm Sonangol said on Wednesday. The Mafumeira Sul project has the capacity to produce 150 000 bbl of oil and 350-million cubic metres of natural gas per day, Sonangol said. The gas will be exported as liquefied natural gas. French firm Total and Italy&#39;s Eni hold minority stakes in the project.
