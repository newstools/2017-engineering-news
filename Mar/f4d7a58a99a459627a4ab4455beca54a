A University of Johannesburg (UJ) student has designed an improved system of beekeeping and beehive production to aid in the survival of bees and, by extension, tackle the problem of decreasing pollination. UJ MTech Industrial Design student Ivan Brown&rsquo;s Beegin concept involves a lightweight concrete beehive &ndash; a more durable, low-cost and protective structure than traditional structures. The concept emerged through participatory development with beekeepers and urban farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown was&nbsp;selected to exhibit his project at this week&rsquo;s Design Indaba Festival, in Cape Town, because he is passionate about tackling the problem of deteriorating bee populations, which is increasing globally. He aims to develop beekeeping technology that are accessible, affordable and sustainable for small-scale farming communities to stimulate socioeconomic development. &ldquo;The project emerged from thorough research. I interviewed urban farmers who said they were interested in beekeeping but could not afford the equipment,&nbsp;and I interviewed beekeepers who explained that the industry was in decline owing to vandalism, diseases, pests, fires, floods and pesticides,&rdquo; he explains. He states that five urban farmers and five beekeepers are testing the system. &ldquo;The aim of the project is to develop an appropriate system for beekeeping in South Africa.&nbsp; If successful, it will contribute towards food security.&rdquo;
