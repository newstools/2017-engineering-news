South Africa&#39;s finance minister Pravin Gordhan said on Wednesday he will &quot;open a new chapter&quot; of his life if speculation that President Jacob Zuma is set to sack him proves correct. Speaking after the funeral of anti-apartheid icon Ahmed Kathrada, Gordhan told eNCA television: &quot;You deal with it in a professional way ... and if one is told one&#39;s services are not required any longer, that&#39;s the end of one chapter, and we open a new chapter.&quot;
