Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it would buy a 25% stake in a natural gas-rich block, offshore Mozambique, from Italy&#39;s Eni for $2.8-billion in cash. The offshore gas reserves discovered by Eni in Mozambique are large enough to need a giant liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant. The east African nation&#39;s proximity to Asian and Middle Eastern growth markets could make it a highly lucrative project. Eni will continue to lead a floating LNG project and all exploration and production in the block, Area 4, while Exxon will lead the construction and operation of natural gas liquefaction facilities onshore. Eni sold 20% of its Area 4 license to China&#39;s CNPC for $4.2 billion in 2013, but oil and gas prices have more than halved since then. Eni, which operates Area 4, currently holds a 50% indirect stake in the block through a 71.4% stake in Eni East Africa. Galp Energia, KOGAS and Mozambique&#39;s State-owned energy firm ENH each own 10% in Area 4. Upon closing of the deal, Eni and Exxon will each own a 35.7% stake in Eni East Africa, while CNPC will own 28.6%. Reuters last year reported that Eni had wrapped up long-running talks to sell a multi-billion dollar stake in its planned Mozambique LNG development to Exxon.
