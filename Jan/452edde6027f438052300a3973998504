Eskom on Thursday reiterated its call to defaulting municipalities to pay their outstanding debts and avoid electricity interruptions. The utility stressed that failure to honour the outstanding debt will compel it to reactivate the electricity interruptions, by issuing the schedule for the next round of interruptions in bulk electricity supply to the affected municipalities on February 1. &ldquo;I sincerely hope that the municipalities take full advantage of the opportunity to make payments and the necessary arrangements towards the eradication of the overdue arrear amounts,&rdquo; Eskom interim CEO Matshela Koko said on Thursday.
