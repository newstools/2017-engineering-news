Despite having connected more than 162 000 new customers to the grid in the last nine months, State-owned power provider Eskom has still experienced a 1%, or 2 252 GWh, drop in energy demand. For this reason, Eskom interim CEO Matshela Koko has called on &ldquo;energy-intensive&rdquo; industry to reinvest in their local operations to use the surplus electricity Eskom currently harboured, noting that the company was &ldquo;open for business&rdquo;. The power provider stated that it could meet any increase in demand until 2021, owing to operational surplus capacity, which averaged 5 600 MW at peak this year. &ldquo;Every single day we have excess capacity of 3 600 MW &ndash; the size of the Matla power station,&rdquo; said Koko. To further address the surplus, Eskom has increased cross-border sales into the Southern African Development Community by 25%, or 2 341 GWh, and aimed to further increase domestic and export sales. &ldquo;We are challenged by [chairperson] Dr Ben [Ngubane] to reach universal access by 2020. Every South African must have access by this year. We also have over 600-million people in the [Southern African] region that do not have access to electricity,&rdquo; Koko said, noting that Eskom needed to grow its sales to the region by 7% year-on-year, while it targeted local sales increases of 10%. Meanwhile, Public Enterprise Minister Lynne Brown explained that when the Integrated Resources Plan was developed in 2010, it was based on the economy growing by 5%, &ldquo;but there has been no growth, as well as no demand for electricity growth&rdquo;. &ldquo;Demand for electricity has been fairly flat for the last decade . . . there needs to be clear consideration of the rate at which new capacity is being added to the grid, [which leads to] excess capacity,&rdquo; she noted. Further, Brown pointed out that the addition of extra capacity, would result in additional costs to the company and consequently higher tariffs. &ldquo;The Eskom board would fail in its duty if it did not consider the burden of high costs on consumers,&rdquo; she added. However, she pointed out that &ldquo;very positively&rdquo;, South Africa&rsquo;s power dialogue has shifted from load-shedding and its impact on the economy, to long-term and sustainable energy solutions. &ldquo;At some point, I was called the Minister of Load Shedding,&rdquo; she quipped.
