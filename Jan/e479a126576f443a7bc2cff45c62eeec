The World Bank&#39;s board of executive directors has approved a $225-million loan to Tanzania to improve water supply in the African nation&#39;s commercial capital Dar es Salaam, the bank said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanzania plans to raise $900-million in fiscal year 2016/17 to fund public investment projects in the transport, energy and water sectors. Loans and grants are an important source of foreign exchange for east Africa&#39;s second-biggest economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dar es Salaam currently accounts for 40% of the urban population or 4.4-million inhabitants . . . and is expected to continue to be the favoured destination for the bulk of new urban residents,&quot; the bank said in a statement late on Thursday. The bank said the new financing, which is expected to benefit close to two-million people, will support the strengthening of capacities for integrated water resources planning and management in Tanzania and improve access to water supply and sanitation services.
