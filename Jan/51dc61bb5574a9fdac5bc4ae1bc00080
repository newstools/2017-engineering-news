South Africa&#39;s rand weakened more than 1% early on Monday in what one trader said was fresh risk aversion amid rumors of a cabinet reshuffle. At 0800, the local unit traded 1.13% weaker at 13.6175 against the dollar. &quot;Risk sentiment is taking a bit of a knock following the latest political developments on possible cabinet reshuffle on the domestic front,&quot; Jana van Deventer, a trader at ETM said. The rand weakened on Friday, hurt by media reports that President Jacob Zuma was considering firing ministers who backed calls for his resignation in November.
