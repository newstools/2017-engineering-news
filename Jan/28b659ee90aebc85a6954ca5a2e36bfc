Johannesburg commuters frequenting the double-decker bridge section on the M1 should prepare for more disruptions between February 4 and 18, as two of the four northbound lanes will be closed during off-peak hours, the Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA) said on Monday. During peak hour traffic, this will be reduced to the closure of one lane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Motorists are urged to familiarise themselves with the lane reductions during off-peak and peak times, plan their routes in advance to avoid delays and to consider alternative routes,&rdquo; the JRA said in a statement. Further, it encouraged commuters to consider using public transport, including the city&rsquo;s Rea Vaya bus rapid transit system, Metrobus, Metrorail, the Gautrain and taxis. Now at an advanced stage, the double-decker bridge rehabilitation includes structural repairs, rehabilitation and maintenance to bridge beams, asphalt surfacing, expansion joints, drainage systems and the installation of new road signs. The majority of the repairs are presently being carried out at night to avoid traffic disruption. &ldquo;However, to ensure the project reaches completion in the shortest amount of time with minimal impact to motorists, the [lane closures] need to be implemented,&rdquo; the JRA said.
