Tanzania opened a new public transport system in its commercial capital on Wednesday, in an effort to ease the journeys of-millions of commuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A city of four-million people, Dar es Salaam until now has had only a haphazard transport system, based on mostly private mini-buses. The new network, paid for by a $290-million loan from the World Bank, will comprise more than 100 buses operating on dedicated bus lanes into the centre of the city. &quot;We want Dar es Salaam to become a modern city,&quot; Tanzanian President John Magufuli said as he inaugurated the new Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit System.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said plans were also under way to build a 200 km diesel-electric commuter rail network between Dar es Salaam and the nearby town of Morogoro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magufuli, nicknamed &quot;The Bulldozer&quot; for pushing through projects, was instrumental in implementing the rapid bus transit system when he served as the country&#39;s works minister, before becoming president in November 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The impact of this new high-capacity transportation system on Dar es Salaam will be quite significant as residents continue to adapt to it,&quot; said Bella Bird, the World Bank country director for Tanzania.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With its population expected to reach 10-million in 2030, Dar es Salaam needs a well-functioning transit system to relieve congestion and to promote its productivity and competitiveness as a commercial hub, which are vital for further economic growth and improvement of the quality of life of its citizens.&rdquo;
