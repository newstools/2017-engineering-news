Grain farmers association Grain SA has called for greater transparency in the reporting of import and export contracts, as local producers&#39; competitiveness was being hampered by unchecked imports. &ldquo;Currently there is no mechanism to report import and export contracts. This is totally one-sided and only the traders have access to this information and the producers don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;A great number of permits for US genetically modified organism (GMO) maize imports were [recently] issued; however, the same GMO events are not available to local producers. Such exceptions should only be made at times when food security is at risk,&rdquo; the organisation argued, adding that excessive imports of maize would only put prices under further pressure. &ldquo;This is detrimental to the profitability of local grain producers, who are already facing pressures from a dry and difficult season,&rdquo; it said. Further, Grain SA noted that the imports caused great uncertainty and allowed market players to force the market in a certain direction. &ldquo;We feel strongly that a free market system can only function optimally if the market information is available to all role-players all the time. The declaration of import and export contracts, as well as changes to it, remains crucial to the market,&rdquo; Grain SA said.
