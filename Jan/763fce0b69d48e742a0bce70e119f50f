JSE-listed Distribution and Warehousing Network (Dawn) is embarking on a rights issue to raise R350-million in gross proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet to allow for the alignment of its capital structure to its business model and the current environment. Dawn has agreed terms with a potential underwriter and expects the proposed rights issue to be fully underwritten. &ldquo;In addition, the company has received undertakings of support for the proposed rights issue from shareholders representing in excess of 60% of Dawn&rsquo;s issued share capital,&rdquo; the company said in a cautionary statement to shareholders on Wednesday. Dawn will convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to obtain the necessary approvals to implement the offer early in March.
