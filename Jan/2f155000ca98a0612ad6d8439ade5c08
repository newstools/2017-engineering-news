Independent fuel distribution company Puma Energy&rsquo;s new fuel storage facility in Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal, has become fully operational and the company has started supplying aviation fuel to the OR Tambo International Airport, in Johannesburg. Puma Energy established its newest storage facility, which is housed at the Bidvest Tank Terminal, in response to growing demand for refined products, driven by greater market needs for higher-grade fuels. The company stated that the facility would ensure energy supply to the market, as well as create jobs. The facility has a storage capacity of 46-million litres and stores diesel, mogas 95, JetA1 and liquid paraffin. Fuel will be distributed by rail and road. &ldquo;Puma Energy is delighted to launch its new facilities across South Africa. When we entered the South African market at the beginning of 2016, we outlined an aggressive plan to fulfil our growth strategy,&rdquo; said Puma COO Jonathan Molapo. Puma Energy also operates the 110-million-litre Matola storage terminal, in Mozambique. Meanwhile, the company started operations at the OR Tambo airport on January 1, with fuel transported to the airport from the Maputo and Richards Bay facilities. &ldquo;Customers will benefit from increased supply security, competitive pricing and high-quality Puma jet fuel. We are pleased to start the year with this entry and look forward to serving new commercial airlines,&rdquo; Puma Energy aviation division global head Seamus Kilgallon noted on Tuesday. &nbsp;
