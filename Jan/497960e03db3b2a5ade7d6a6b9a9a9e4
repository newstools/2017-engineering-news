A R216-million upgrade of five industrial parks, which was about to get under way, would have a positive impact immediately with most of the labour and construction materials being procured from those areas, the Department of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday. The department said in a statement that it had identified a need to revitalise industrial parks around the country, mainly in the former homelands, as part of efforts to promote industrialisation, manufacturing and job creation. The first phase of revitalisation of the Nkowankowa, Ekandustria, Bodirelo, Phuthaditjhaba and Garankuwa industrial parks had been approved late last year. The department said the programme would be implemented in four phases, with the first being the upgrading of security infrastructure. Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies said: &ldquo;We would like to see these parks operating as centres of excellence and beehives of economic activity, contributing to the growth and diversification of our economy. &ldquo;The revitalisation process will ensure that the upgraded parks appeal to private investors, provide a conducive environment and attract investments that will create jobs and assist in promoting economic transformation,&rdquo; Davies added.
