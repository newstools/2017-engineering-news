A poultry sector task team established by the South African government to deal with the challenges facing the domestic poultry industry has made &ldquo;significant progress&rdquo; across various work streams, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said on Friday. Domestic poultry producers continue to express concern about growing imports of poultry products and some producers have announced plans to retrench workers. To respond to the complex challenges facing the local poultry industry, government established the poultry sector task team to develop short- and long-term interventions to the challenges. The task team&rsquo;s work streams include trade measures; investigating health and quality issues; competitiveness; industry growth and transformation; and industrial financing, incentives and demand-side interventions. The task team comprises representatives from the departments of Trade and Industry, Economic Development and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as well as the Industrial Development Corporation, Poultry South Africa and representatives of the poultry producers, as well as the Food and Allied Workers Union. The DTI on Friday said that, as soon as the necessary technical work had been completed for the short-term interventions, the task team would submit, for final ratification, a set of short-term and shared interventions. These proposals will be submitted to the Ministers concerned and the broader leadership of business and labour involved in the poultry sector. &ldquo;Until support measures can be instituted, we appeal to the industry to do everything possible to prevent any plant closures and retrenchments,&rdquo; the DTI added.
