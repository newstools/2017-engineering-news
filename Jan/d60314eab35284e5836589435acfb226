The Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DoE&rsquo;s) public consultation workshops on the updated draft Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) and the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) will resume in Limpopo on Wednesday. This followed on the first series of public consultation sessions, which were held in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape in December. The consultations will then move to Mpumalanga on January 27, the North West on January 31 and the Free State on February 3. The workshops aim to unpack the IEP and IRP draft plans, detail the scenarios for South Africa&rsquo;s energy mix up to 2050 and obtain comment and inputs on the draft from stakeholders. The draft IEP and IRP plans were approved by Cabinet in November.
