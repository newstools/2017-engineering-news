Chevron South Africa chairperson Shashi Rabbipal has succeeded Maurice Radebe as chairperson of the South African Petroleum Industry Association (Sapia) for 2017. Rabbipal will be chairperson to the board of governors &ndash; Sapia&rsquo;s governing body &ndash; which comprises ten representatives from member companies. The chairperson is rotated on an annual basis. &ldquo;The position of chairperson is very critical to Sapia as it oversees implementation of the association&rsquo;s strategy on clearly identified focus areas such as transformation, clean fuels and environmental compliance. &ldquo;I am looking forward to supporting Rabbipal in the next 12 months as we tackle critical industry issues that should be resolved and clarified during the course of the year,&rdquo; Sapia executive director Avhapfani Tshifularo said in a statement issued on Thursday. &ldquo;I look forward to working with Avhapfani Tshifularo . . . and the board of governors to continue Sapia&rsquo;s good work as it relates to economic and social progress, as well as ensuring security of fuel supply and facilitating a fair regulatory framework for all our members,&rdquo;&nbsp;added Rabbipal. Rabbipal began his career with Chevron South Africa 26 years ago and fulfilled various general management roles in sales, marketing and lubricants for Europe, Africa, Middle East and Pakistan. He has served on the boards of Chevron South Africa and Chevron Romania and, as a result, has accumulated extensive experience and knowledge within the industry. Within Sapia, he previously served on the transformation subcommittee and has been a member of the board of governors from 2015.
