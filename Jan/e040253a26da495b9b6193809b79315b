Key role-players in the UK&rsquo;s Business Process Services (BPS) industry with operations in South Africa have agreed to work with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to enhance the country&rsquo;s value proposition, the DTI said on Tuesday. The decision to set up a technical working group was taken at a meeting between Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies and BPS investors in London. Davies is on a two-day visit to the UK to engage the British government on the Brexit transaction and to showcase opportunities for investment in some of South Africa&rsquo;s priority sectors. Davies also met with Chatham House, the respected independent policy institute, to discuss trade and investment policy, including South Africa&rsquo;s economic outlook. Outlining the South African government&rsquo;s efforts to encourage private-sector investment with InvestSA, a one-stop shop to boost investment, Davies said: &ldquo;The aim is to remove administrative barriers, reduce regulatory inefficiencies, improve turnaround times and co-ordinate and fast-track investment inquiries.&rdquo; Davies will on Tuesday meet his counterpart in the UK, Dr Liam Fox, to discuss Brexit. He will also engage with investors in the renewable energy sector and traders in the agricultural sector in other scheduled meetings.
