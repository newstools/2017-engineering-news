As the UK prepares to exit the European Union (EU), South Africa is engaging the country to strengthen existing trade ties and identify new mutually beneficial investment opportunities. South Africa&rsquo;s Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies and the UK Secretary of State for International Trade Dr Liam Fox met this week in London to discuss trade and economic relations. &ldquo;We must ensure that we have a predictable trade and investment environment for mutual benefit for both parties. As we work to achieve this, South Africa looks forward to discussing how our trade post-Brexit could build on the recently concluded Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU,&rdquo; Davies said in a statement on Wednesday. &ldquo;As we become an even more outward-looking country, we will continue building on our relationship with South Africa,&rdquo; added Fox. The UK is the biggest destination in the EU for South African investment, accounting for 30% of the African country&rsquo;s investments into Europe. In addition, 46% of South Africa&rsquo;s global investment originates from the UK, with South Africa the largest recipient &ndash; at 30%, or &pound;13.1-billion &ndash; of UK foreign direct investment in Africa. Bilateral trade in goods and services between the UK and South Africa stood at &pound;7.6-billion in 2015, with UK exports of goods and services having increased by 25% in the last decade. South Africa&rsquo;s exports into the UK have increased more than 5% a year over the past ten years and the country is the third-biggest trading partner for the UK in the Commonwealth.
