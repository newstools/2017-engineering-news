Three young South Africans have developed a smartphone app similar to dating app Tinder, but with one important difference &ndash; Carter aims to facilitate a long-term relationship between its users and the cars of their dreams. The Carter app builds a shortlist of suitable cars for the user by working through a list of preferences. The system learns from the user&rsquo;s actions, pulling them closer to the cars they should be considering. &nbsp; Carter&rsquo;s developers say the platform aims to alleviate the complexity of buying a new car by making it easier and more fun to shop for that dream vehicle. It removes the hassle of having to contact multiple dealerships for quotes and navigating a myriad of technical specifications to see which car suits the potential buyer&rsquo;s needs and wallet best. &nbsp; &ldquo;We are looking to create something special with Carter,&rdquo; says co-founder Vikash Govindjee. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing hasn&rsquo;t been done anywhere else in the world. Our platform helps customers find their perfect new car and complete the deal via their mobile phone. It&rsquo;s a new-car shopping mall in the palm of your hand.&rdquo; &nbsp; Tom Gardner, co-founder, adds that their platform is vastly different to existing options.&nbsp; &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t an Edgars for new cars. There isn&rsquo;t anywhere you can browse hatchbacks or compact sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) side by side. &ldquo;The problem with this is that there may be the perfect compact SUV out there for you, you just don&rsquo;t know about it. By creating a virtual showroom that allows people to browse by usage requirements, we have created a virtual Edgars for cars.&rdquo; &nbsp; Carter&rsquo;s Amit Bholla believes &ldquo;very few platforms&rdquo; have pulled off the fun element for consumers.&nbsp; &ldquo;The majority of other platforms ask you which make and model car you want. They assume you know what you want or need. Carter&rsquo;s mission is to empower the consumer. We have built a fun and friendly platform to help you find the right car and then conveniently source great deals from reputable dealers. &nbsp; &ldquo;Take the swipe left or right functionality; by backing it with a smart learning algorithm, we can learn what consumers like or dislike,&rdquo; he adds. &nbsp; Carter&rsquo;s app is currently available on the Apple iStore, as well as the Android Play Store.&nbsp; &nbsp;
