The rand is continuing its strong showing after breaking through a significant level of R13.30/$ on Wednesday on the back of a bigger risk appetite for emerging market currencies and a strengthening of the euro. &ldquo;There is now a possibility that the rand could break through the R13.20/$ and R14.20/&euro; levels,&rdquo; said John Cairns, currency strategist at RMB in a company note issued on Thursday. The rand&rsquo;s gains on Wednesday were justified by the rally in other currencies. The scope for a break to reach its lowest level against the US dollar since late 2015 is therefore high. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about sentiment towards US President Donald Trump. Look for a rand break if he keeps to his business tone and avoids bashing China and Mexico,&rdquo; Cairns said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a big if, particularly if one considers his &lsquo;wall&rsquo; and &lsquo;immigration&rsquo; comments overnight.&rdquo; Cairns added that Trump is supposed to be the &ldquo;President of Uncertainty&rdquo;. &ldquo;The lack of clarity on policies was supposed to make 2017 a volatile year, yet remarkably the &lsquo;fear gauge&rsquo; index of expected equity volatility has dropped to its lowest level since the middle of 2014,&rdquo; said Cairns. Rand volatility is therefore also decreasing. Wichard Cilliers, director and head of currency dealing at TreasuryOne, said if the rand reaches R13.15/$ on Thursday it could &ldquo;briefly run back to&rdquo; R12.90/$. &ldquo;But this is very opportunistic and markets need to be watched closely.&rdquo; In the emerging market currency space, the Turkish Lira has dethroned the rand as the most volatile currency. &ldquo;But if you think back to what happened politically in Turkey last year,&rdquo; Cilliers said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather perturbing that we as a politically and financially stable nation are still ranked so high in the volatility statistics.&rdquo; At 13:00 the rand traded 0.30% stronger at R13.28/$.
