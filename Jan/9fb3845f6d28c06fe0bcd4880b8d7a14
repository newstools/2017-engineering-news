The Western Cape&rsquo;s average overall dam level has dipped below 40% and is continuing its rapid decline despite efforts to reduce water consumption. While not yet at a &ldquo;crisis level&rdquo;, Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell on Monday said some regions had been declared disaster areas over the past year. &ldquo;It is massively concerning to see dam levels on average at 39.4%. We are still some way off from our rainy season and, therefore, once more, call on consumers to assist us in using water responsibly,&rdquo; he said in a statement on Monday, cautioning that water use remained high and dam levels were &ldquo;falling fast&rdquo;. Citing the latest data by the National Department of Water and Sanitation, he noted that the Cape Town system dams combined had fallen to 39.9% this week, compared with the 42.03% last week and the 50.36% reported at this time last year. The Berg River catchment dams registered at 46.81%, a decline on last week&rsquo;s 49.21% and last year&rsquo;s level of 47.01%. Meanwhile, the Breede River catchment dams were 38.16% full this week, compared with 48.56% during the same period last year, and the Gouritz River catchment dam levels plunged to 25.75% this week from the 52.48% reported during the corresponding week last year. The Olifants/Doorn River catchment dams was the only ones in the system to register a rise in levels, from 44.20% last year to 54.20% by Monday. &ldquo;We are constantly monitoring the situation and municipalities are implementing additional measures including restrictions and tariff increases where necessary,&rdquo; Bredell concluded.
