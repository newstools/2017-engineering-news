South Africa still had much to do to avoid potentially being downgraded to junk status in the year ahead, with the country having already &ldquo;dodged some bullets&rdquo; at the end of last year. During a panel discussion at Deloitte&rsquo;s Africa Outlook 2017, Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P&rsquo;s) MD Konrad Reuss said the agency still saw more downside risks than upside risks in the country, owing to the negative outlook on the country&#39;s ratings. &ldquo;There are three topics that will drive the outlook for the country, including gross domestic product (GDP) growth . . . we have certain expectations for [GDP to improve], along with fiscal improvement. If there is no delivery in that regard, it will put pressure on the ratings,&rdquo; he noted. Further, Reuss pointed out that weakening institutions that impact on policy frameworks and implementation, could also negatively impact on South Africa&#39;s ratings. However, he added that, as a result of the recovery in commodity and oil prices, goals that were not achieved in 2016 are achievable this year, unless bad policy decision are made. He added that S&amp;P&rsquo;s would keep a close eye on State-owned enterprises, the risks emanating from these entities and the pressure this would put on government&rsquo;s fiscal and debt position. &ldquo;This could also put pressure on the ratings,&rdquo; he noted. Deloitte Africa Emerging Markets &amp; Africa MD Dr Martyn Davies, meanwhile, said countries could learn from their Asian counterparts, where the State is the entrepreneur, to get a similar mindset of competitiveness and entrepreneurial capability. &ldquo;One thing I am hoping to see in the year ahead, and our Finance Minister [Pravin Gordhan] could not even say the word last year, is privatisation. Private capital is the greatest force of development and what we are seeing is lethargic growth, a lack of agility, innovation and a lack of high-performance economies on our continent &ndash; largely and almost entirely due to poor management reform at State-owned assets,&rdquo; he said. Meanwhile, Davies pointed out that, with South Africa&rsquo;s economy still being 60% driven by its resources sector, it will need to start thinking about the macro-forces that play a role and further focus on becoming an ideas-driven economy. This, he said, should not only be confined to the borders of the country, but should become the norm for the whole continent.
