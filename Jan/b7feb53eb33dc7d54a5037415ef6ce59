The upcoming Africa Power Roundtable (APR) will seek to further address challenges such as regulatory certainty to enable investment in long-term grid connected power projects on the continent. The event, to be held in Sandton on February 1 and 2 and sponsored by investment and advisory company DLO Energy Resources, will also look at various investment opportunities such as South Africa&rsquo;s imminent gas-to-power programme and renewables projects in East and West Africa. At the centre of the discussion will be a focus on regional integration through the use of regional power pools, natural resources such as gas, and cross-border transactions in addressing the continent&rsquo;s energy security. &nbsp; &ldquo;The role of local developers is a crucial one for us. The idea for these programmes should be to create local developers so that we are eventually able to do these projects without a majority of the shareholding being held by international players,&rdquo; DLO MD Linda Mabhena-Olagunju said in a statement.
