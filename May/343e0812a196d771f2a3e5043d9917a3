The North Riding-based Builders Warehouse, which forms part of the Builders Warehouse chain of stores owned by management company Massmart, has installed a 126 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant, which comprises 400 roof-mounted polycrystalline PV panels. The plant will provide 70%&nbsp;of the store&rsquo;s daytime energy requirements and 16% of the store&#39;s total yearly energy consumption. &nbsp; The store has also introduced other green technologies to reduce its overall water and energy consumption including daylight harvesting, lighting controllers, energy efficient lighting, evaporative cooling systems and rainwater harvesting tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Massmart&rsquo;s Makro Carnival and Makro Woodmead stores also use renewable energy technology to reduce their reliance on the national grid.
