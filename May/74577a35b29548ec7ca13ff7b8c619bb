&quot;Massive&quot; load-shedding could begin as early as next week in Zimbabwe - because the cash-strapped authorities still haven&#39;t settled an $80-million debt to Eskom, the Herald reports. The State-run Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) has been unable to keep up with a payment plan agreed upon with Eskom earlier this year. Now &quot;frantic&quot; efforts are being made to meet a May 31 payment deadline, Zesa boss Josh Chifamba was quoted as saying. Eskom&#39;s Matshela Koko has told Zesa supplies could be cut &quot;with effect from June 1&quot;, says the paper. It&#39;s understood that Zesa doesn&#39;t have to pay the full $80-million back immediately but must meet the shortfall on the debt repayment plan. This is bad news for Zimbabweans who&#39;ve got used to mostly uninterrupted power for more than a year now. That&#39;s partly due to a downturn in industrial demand inside Zimbabwe. Power-shedding was a daily reality during Zimbabwe&#39;s last economic crisis up to early 2009. Online watchdog @ZimMediaReview noted grimly that the load-shedding warnings come &quot;just in time for winter.&quot; And a Herald reader suggested the authorities &quot;print more useless bond notes and ship them to South Africa and see if Eskom will accept them as payment!&quot; in a reference to the special-to-Zimbabwe bank notes introduced late last year. The bond notes have failed to solve Zimbabwe&#39;s cash shortages.
