Wind turbine manufacturer Nordex has successfully deployed 37 wind turbines in the Eastern Cape as part of Round 3 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. Producing 111 MW of power, Nordex&rsquo;s Delta Generation wind turbines have started operation. It is the first batch to be installed in South Africa by Nordex. The turbines are specifically designed to generate greater output in high wind conditions and have the lowest sound emissions in their class. &ldquo;We are extremely proud to be extending our strong foothold in the South African renewable energy market with the completion of this wind farm project,&rdquo; MD Anne Henschel said. She added that the company has supplied wind turbines for five South African wind projects, with a combined capacity of 563 MW.
