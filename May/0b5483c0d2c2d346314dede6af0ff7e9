The decision by General Motors (GM) to pull out of South Africa will, most likely, cut 589 jobs at GM South Africa (GMSA) as the company restructures to form Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSA), says GMSA. GMSA employs around 1 800 people. US vehicle manufacturer GM announced last week that GMSA would cease Chevrolet production and sales in South Africa by the end of 2017. Isuzu KB one-ton and Isuzu truck production would continue, under the IMSA banner, with Japan&rsquo;s Isuzu Motors to acquire GMSA&rsquo;s Port Elizabeth plant from GM. GM says it has &ldquo;commenced the legally required Section 189 process&rdquo;, which links the number of job opportunities to the operational requirements of the company. GM says the 589-number is &ldquo;not final and is subject to the consultation process with employees and their representative organisations. Therefore, GM cannot provide any further details on this point until the consultation process has been completed&rdquo;. &nbsp;
