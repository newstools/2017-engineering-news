The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) will lead a 25-member delegation drawn from all special economic zones (SEZs) in South Africa on an investment roadshow to the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen from May 6 to 11. The objective of the roadshow is to attract investors to the country&rsquo;s SEZs. &ldquo;As our focus regarding the SEZ implementation programme is on attracting investments into the SEZs, the ultimate objective of roadshows of this nature is to bring high-level local and international investors together with a view to entice them to invest in South Africa,&rdquo; Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies said in a statement. The roadshow is part of the implementation of the undertakings agreed to in the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement (CSPA) signed between South Africa and China at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit, in Johannesburg, in 2015. China agreed to support South Africa and Africa&rsquo;s industrialisation and beneficiation initiatives. &ldquo;China is the second-biggest economy in the world and South Africa&rsquo;s biggest trading partner. China&rsquo;s market remains a key strategic priority for South Africa&rsquo;s raw material and value-added products,&rdquo; Davies said. He added that the DTI has entered into many strategic partnerships with the Chinese government. &ldquo;The main purpose of these strategic partnerships is to foster cooperation on investment promotion and facilitation, infrastructure development, the exchange of information and human resource development,&rdquo; Davies noted. &nbsp;
