Telecommunications giant MTN Group on Monday signed a nonbinding preliminary agreement to invest R540-million into Iranian fixed broadband provider Iranian Net for a 49% stake in the company. Further investments of R3.4-billion in both equity and loans will also be made over the next five years to facilitate Iranian Net meeting its roll-out targets.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;This investment represents an opportunity to capitalise on the continued strong growth expected in the Iranian broadband market, with an initial focus on eight of the main cities,&rdquo; MTN said in a statement. MTN in November last year revealed plans to expand its activities in Iran. Subsidiary company MTN Irancell in February also invested in Iran Internet Group, which owns ride-hailing service Snapp.
