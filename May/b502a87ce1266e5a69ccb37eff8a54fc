South Africa needs to provide policy clarity to boost investor confidence in the wake of a cabinet reshuffle and a pledge to introduce &quot;radical economic transformation&quot;, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Tuesday. &quot;The debates around radical economic transformation are ongoing,&quot; Gigaba told parliament&#39;s finance committee. He said the ruling African National Congress, which steers government policy, had not yet defined what the transformation entailed. &quot;We know that we need to continue acting conscientiously to do what we have to do, including providing policy clarity on a number of areas . . . to boost business and investor confidence.&quot;
