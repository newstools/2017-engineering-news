Congo Republic inaugurated a $92-million hydroelectric dam constructed by China Gezhouba Group on Monday, in a boost to the oil-producing country&#39;s agriculture and forestry sectors, the government said. The 19.2 MW dam in the northern town of Liouesso brings Congo&#39;s hydroelectric production to 213 MW, nearly half of total national power output. The country produced just 89 MW in 2000, according to the government. &quot;The Liouesso dam will give great productive capacity to the businesses installed in the region,&quot; President Denis Sassou Nguesso said at the inauguration ceremony, though his infrastructure minister noted the government had yet to find buyers for three-quarters of the dam&#39;s output. Oil accounts for around 65% of GDP in the central African nation, Africa&#39;s fourth-largest crude producer, but it is aiming to diversify its economy by increasing investments in infrastructure as well as in the mining and forestry sectors.
