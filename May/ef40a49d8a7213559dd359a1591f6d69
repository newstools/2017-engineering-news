Africa-focused oil company Tullow Oil said it encountered 75 m of net oil pay in two zones at an exploration well in northern Kenya. The Emekuya-1 well, located in the South Lokichar basin in north-western Kenya, would eventually be developed to full field development, the company said on Wednesday. The well has proven oil charge across a significant part of the Greater Etom structure, Tullow said. &quot;The discovery not only adds more recoverable resources to the current portfolio, but, along with Etom-2 and Erut-1 (wells), establishes the &#39;northern triangle&#39; part of the South Lokichar basin as an independent production hub,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst Sasikanth Chilukuru said. Tullow operates Blocks 13T and 10BB with 50% equity and is partnered by Africa Oil Corp and Maersk Oil with 25% each. The Emekuya-1 well is located in Block 13T. Earlier this year, the company said its Erut-1 well, located in the same block, discovered oil with 25 m of net oil pay. According to Davy Research, Tullow&#39;s latest guidance for discovered resources in the South Lokichar basin is 750-million barrels. Shares of the company were up 2.9% at 207p by 08:10 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.
