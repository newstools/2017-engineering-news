The South African Communist Party (SACP) has welcomed the reassertion of the African National Congress&rsquo;s Broadcasting Digital Migration (BDM) policy, including encryption.&nbsp; &ldquo;The SACP agrees with the basic principles underlying the policy, specifically the strategic aim to strengthen free-to-air, public and community television broadcasting. The SACP campaigned against an amendment pushed in government by former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi effectively undermining the policy,&rdquo; the SACP clarified in a statement. In May 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeals found the amendment to be edict, irrational, invalid and set it aside. The SACP raised its objection when Muthambi appealed. &ldquo;Both her amendment and the appeal further delayed South Africa&rsquo;s analogue to digital terrestrial television migration,&rdquo; it said. The SACP states that government must use the BDM process to expand access to new entrants.&nbsp; &ldquo;Encryption significantly lowers the financial barriers to entry for new entrants in the pay television sector, while allowing for State revenue generation to recover, over a few years, the cost of the initial stated subsidisation of set-top boxes (STBs).&rdquo; The SACP added that government should uplift content producers in poor communities by means of a decisive pursuit of encrypted television broadcasting to host their content through a &ldquo;pay as you view&rdquo; system or subscription. Further, the SACP stated that the inclusion of encryption should give South Africans, including those qualifying for STBs, access to a variety of digital platforms including e-government services. &ldquo;Examples include &lrm;enabling people to receive, in their home language, information about government services, including pensions, social grants and health services.&rdquo;
