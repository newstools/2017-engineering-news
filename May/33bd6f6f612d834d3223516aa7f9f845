JOHANNESBURG &ndash; Former South African mines minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi said on Tuesday, without giving evidence, that power utility Eskom&#39;s CEO and chairperson asked him in 2015 to suspend Glencore&#39;s mining licences to put pressure on the commodities firm to sell a coal mine. Khulani Qoma, a spokesperson for Eskom board&#39;s, denied the allegation, saying it was &quot;devoid of logic&quot;. Glencore in 2015 placed its Optimum coal mine under protection from creditors and later sold it to South Africa&#39;s Tegeta Exploration and Resources, a firm controlled by the Gupta brothers, who deny allegations they wield excessive influence over President Jacob Zuma. &quot;They (Eskom&#39;s CEO and chairperson) insisted that I must suspend all the Glencore mining licences,&quot; Ramatlhodi told local media, adding he declined to give in to the pressure.
