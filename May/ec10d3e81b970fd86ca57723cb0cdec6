Royal HaskoningDHV, together with Haskoning Botswana, has been awarded the contract to review the masterplan of the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport Special Economic Zone (SSKIA-SEZ), in Gaborone, Botswana. Eight strategic areas across the country have been identified for promoting the development of a variety of industries that will lead to the diversification of the country&rsquo;s economy through the public and private sectors, as well as public&ndash;private partnerships. &ldquo;The SSKIA-SEZ is a six-month project that is planned to be completed by the end of August and fits in well with our goal to help develop business and job opportunities on the continent,&rdquo; Royal HaskoningDHV transport and planning Africa director Manfred Uken said in a statement. The SSKIA-SEZ will be a mixed-use economic zone that will house several organisations, including the Civil Aviation Authority of Botswana and the Botswana Innovation Hub, which is a science and technology park to aid in diversifying the economy and helping transform Botswana into a knowledge economy. Botswana Investment and Trade will also be incorporated within the mixed-use economic zone.
