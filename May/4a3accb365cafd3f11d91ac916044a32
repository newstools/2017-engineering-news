The annual budget of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) remains stable, in real terms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in line with inflation,&rdquo; DST director-general Dr Phil Mjwara told Engineering News Online at a press briefing on Tuesday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not declining, it&rsquo;s not growing.&rdquo; However, exchange rate volatility did have an impact as rand weakness drove up the costs of acquiring scientific and research equipment from abroad. In response to a question from another journalist, Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor said &ldquo;[w]e do know we [the country] are going through a low growth phase at the moment. We are working hard at the DST to contribute to increased growth through new industries and products.&rdquo; Funding was not at the level that the Department would like, and it was working on developing international partnerships to access foreign funding. &ldquo;We do rather well in that regard,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;We are also pursuing a number of initiatives with the private sector.&rdquo; The DST was also encouraging other government departments, and not just at national level, to invest in innovation. She cited the example of the Gauteng provincial government&rsquo;s support of the Innovation Hub in Pretoria. &ldquo;Really, what you do is not rely on what comes out of national revenue.&rdquo; In her formal statement at the briefing, Pandor reported that her department&rsquo;s budget for 2017/18 was R7.5-billion. &ldquo;[T]he Department will maintain a clear focus on human capital development and the continuous modernisation of research infrastructure,&rdquo; she assured. The DST was heavily involved in achieving four, in particular, outcomes desired by the country&rsquo;s Medium Term Strategic Framework. These are Outcome 2 (a &ldquo;long and healthy life for all South Africans&rdquo;); Outcome 4 (&ldquo;decent employment through inclusive growth&rdquo;); Outcome 5 (a &ldquo;skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive growth path&rdquo;); and Outcome 6 (an &ldquo;efficient, competitive, and responsive economic infrastructure network&rdquo;). To ensure the transformation of the country&rsquo;s human capital, at least 80% of post-graduate bursaries awarded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) would go to black students, 55% to women and 4% to people with disabilities. This transformation, she stated, was a requirement for sustainable growth. The assignment of the DST&rsquo;s 2017/18 budget is as follows: research development and support (which funds research, researchers and research infrastructure) gets R4.3-billion. Socioeconomic innovation partnerships (which are focused on fighting poverty and creating sustainable jobs, human settlements and service delivery) is assigned R1.6-billion. Technology innovation (under which rubric fall the Technology Innovation Agency, or TIA, and the National Intellectual Property Management Office) receives R1.1-billion. International Cooperation and Resources gets R128.7-million and administration is allocated R383.7-million. The Parliamentary grants allocated to agencies reporting to the DST are &ndash; the NRF: R926-million; the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research: R916-million; the Human Sciences Research Council: R305-million; the TIA: R397-million; the Academy of Science of South Africa: R25-million; and the South African National Space Agency: R131-million. These entities can and do also receive separate funding for specific projects. &ldquo;Our theme for this year&rsquo;s budget vote is &lsquo;The Oliver Tambo legacy &ndash; positioning the national system of innovation for the future&rsquo;,&rdquo; affirmed Pandor. &ldquo;OR Tambo wasn&rsquo;t just a luminary of our struggle for freedom; he was also an outstanding mathematics and science teacher.&rdquo;
