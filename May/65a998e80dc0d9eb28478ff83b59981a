JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Power provider Aggreko has signed a ten-year deal for the supply of a 22 MW diesel and 7.5 MW solar-generated hybrid power plant to base metals miner Nevsun&rsquo;s copper and zinc operations in Eritrea. Nevsun owns the Bisha mine, a large, high-grade volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit, located 150 km west of Asmara, producing 2.4-million tonnes of copper concentrate a year. Aggreko&rsquo;s solar-diesel hybrid power package combines cost-effectiveness and renewable energy with the reliability of diesel-generated power to provide uninterrupted power. The hybrid power programme was developed at Aggreko&rsquo;s manufacturing and technology centre, in Dumbarton, Scotland, and uses the latest diesel generators. These are monitored using Aggreko remote monitoring telemetry to ensure optimum operational and fuel efficiencies.
