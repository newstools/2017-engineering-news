The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Wednesday served the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) with its responding pleas to the summonses issued for outstanding e-toll payments against Outa&rsquo;s contributing supporters &ndash; in what is the next round of the civil challenge against the e-toll system implemented in Gauteng. The organisation highlighted the step as its test case, which will highlight why it believed the Gauteng e-toll scheme was introduced unlawfully. The matter is being heard in the North Gauteng High Court, in Pretoria. &ldquo;We regard the e-toll system as unjust and illegal for a number of reasons. We have gathered our facts and prepared our case over the past few years to present compelling arguments and merits which will speak for themselves,&rdquo; said Outa COO Ben Theron. Outa&rsquo;s case is outlined in the action which Sanral filed against Thandanani Truckers and Hauliers which was served a summons for R402 841.62 in unpaid e-toll fees for January 2014 to August 2015. Outa will continue to argue that the toll road system is invalid as it does not comply with public information and consultation requirements in the Sanral Act and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act and that Sanral&rsquo;s toll declarations are unconstitution, as the Constitution requires &ldquo;Supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law&rdquo;. Further, Outa stated that the intention to toll was materially inadequate and flawed, with insufficient notification and time for the public to comment during the public engagement exercise and little consideration given to the few comments that were made. &ldquo;The e-toll fight has been a long journey and we value the support received from the public in this battle; however, the real fight is now only beginning, said Outa chaiperson Wayne Duvenage.
