The process to fill the director-general position at National Treasury, which was recently relinquished by Lungisa Fuzile, is well under way, the National Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday. More than 30 applications, including applications from internal candidates, have been received for the position, which comes with a remuneration package starting at R1.6-million, increasing to R1.9-million a year. The closing date for applications was April 28. The National Treasury said it had finalised a shortlist and that it would now start interviewing candidates. Fuzile resigned as director-general in April, a year before his contract was due to end. His resignation followed shortly after the axing of Pravin Gordhan as Finance Minister and Mcebisi Jonas as Deputy Finance Minister, although the Treasury said at the time that Fuzile had expressed his desire to leave &ldquo;for some time&quot;. Fuzile will leave the department next month.
