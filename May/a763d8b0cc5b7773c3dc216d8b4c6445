A South African solar photovoltaic (PV) project developer won the right this week to build a 50 MW solar power plant in Rajasthan, India, following an intensive competitive-bidding process. Phelan Energy Group (PEG), based in Cape Town, prevailed in an online reverse auction involving 14 preselected solar companies, which duelled for over 10 hours on May 9 to secure the allocation at the Bhadla solar park. PEG reports that its Rs2.62/kWh bid, which translates to R0.54/kWh, set a new solar-tariff benchmark in India, coming in more than 15% lower than a previous Indian record achieved in April. Media reports indicate that Avaada Power, of India, also bid Rs2.62/kWh for a 100 MW project at Bhadla, while SBG Cleantech bid Rs2.63/kWh to construct a 100 MW plant. A total of 27 bids, representing a combined 3 250 MW, were reportedly received for the 250 MW capacity on offer. The tariffs bid were also lower than the average rate of power generated by the coal-fired plant&rsquo;s owned by India&rsquo;s largest power generation utility, NTPC. &ldquo;The result from this bid has proved that solar power is no longer simply an alternative, but is the de facto cheapest form of power available in a coal power-dominated market such as India,&rdquo; PEG chairperson Paschal Phelan said in a statement. PEG subsidiary Solar Capital is a leading solar PV developer in South Africa, with an installed base of 175 MW and a 2 000 MW project pipeline.
