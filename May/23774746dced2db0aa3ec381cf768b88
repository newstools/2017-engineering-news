The South African Reserve Bank is concerned about further downgrades to local currency debt and the impact on the stability of the domestic financial system, it said in a report on Tuesday. Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy has this year suffered from credit ratings downgrades after President Jacob Zuma sacked respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in late March. &quot;The possibility of further downgrades to South Africa&#39;s local currency rating and South Africa consequently being excluded from the remaining bond indices is disconcerting,&quot; the bank said in a financial stability review. The regulator added that should ratings agencies downgrade South African local currency debt further it could have a significant impact on the cost of funding and investment flows. &quot;Market volatility could increase as a result, with sharp losses likely to be recorded in the currency, bond and equity markets, thereby negatively affecting the stability of the domestic financial system,&quot; it said. S&amp;P Global Ratings cut South African foreign debt to subinvestment grade in April, while Fitch downgraded both the foreign and local currency debt to &quot;junk&quot; status. Moody&#39;s, two notches above junk status, has put South Africa on review for a downgrade. Local currency borrowing makes up about 90% of the South Africa&#39;s total R2.2-trillion ($165-billion) of debt.
