Water levels are continuing to drop gradually despite recent good rains that have been experienced in some parts of South Africa. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) on Tuesday said the national water storage decreased from 72.9% last week to 72.7% this week. This was, however, still above the 54% recorded at this time last year. &ldquo;Water users are urged to adhere to water restriction measures imposed by their respective municipalities,&rdquo; the DWS said, noting that low dam levels in the Western Cape were of particular concern. The Cape Town Dams System, which has six dams serving mainly the City of Cape Town (CoC), decreased to 20.8% this week from 21.7% last week and was below the 30.8% at the same time last year. &ldquo;It is important to note that South Africa is a water scarce country and the current water that we have should be used wisely,&rdquo; the DWS stated.
