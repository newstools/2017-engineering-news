Parliament&rsquo;s Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it was considering summoning retailers using the Rules of Parliament, after several retailers did not attend a meeting to provide insights on how pricing and mark-ups of poultry products occur in their companies. Some of the invited retailers, which included Shoprite, Woolworths, Pick n Pay and Spar, instead submitted short written responses to the committee, said committee chairperson Joanmariae Fubbs. &ldquo;The committee took a decision to again invite the retailers to a meeting scheduled for May 9, to discuss the challenges facing the industry. Failure to attend may require a summons to be issued,&rdquo; she said in a statement, noting that which Rule of Parliament to use needed to be decided as &ldquo;requesting stakeholders&rsquo; attendance does not seem to be getting us anywhere&rdquo;. The scheduled meeting on Tuesday debated the challenges affecting the poultry industry with presentations made by the European Union (EU) and the Animal Feed Manufacturers Association. &ldquo;The absence of the retailers was questioned when the EU inferred that a mark-up of up to 45% on poultry products occurs at retail level,&rdquo; Fubbs pointed out, adding that: &ldquo;We expect South Africans to come to Parliament to assist us. It is unacceptable that they are not present at the meeting.&rdquo;
