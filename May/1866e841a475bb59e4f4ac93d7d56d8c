Nigerian systems engineer Godwin Benson has won &pound;25 000 as the winner of the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation. He developed an online digital platform called Tuteria, which links students to qualified tutors in their area and within their budget. Users find the skill they want to learn on an app on their phone, set their budget and wait to be connected to the nearest tutor. &ldquo;Benson&rsquo;s Tuteria invention changes the way Nigerians &ndash; and Africans &ndash; share knowledge and skills with one another. We&rsquo;re proud to have him as our third Africa Prize winner, and we trust Tuteria will go on to change the lives of millions of people who are eager to learn and develop new skills,&rdquo; Ugandan Africa Prize judge Moses Musaazi said. South African Andre Nel was a runner-up with his green tower microgrid system. Entries for the fourth Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation are now open. Individuals and small teams living and working in sub-Saharan Africa, and who have an engineering innovation are invited to enter. The deadline for entries is July 24.
