The Department of Human Settlements has allocated 30% of its budget for building military veterans&rsquo; houses to companies owned by military veterans. &ldquo;No military veterans housing project will be implemented without the allocation of a certain percentage of the work to military veterans&rsquo; companies,&rdquo; Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said on Wednesday, adding that the department would prioritise the families of &quot;deceased cadres&quot; and the &quot;nonstatutory formations&quot;. Speaking at a Military Veterans Dialogue, she highlighted that around 5 000 individuals needed decent shelter. The veterans, in turn, raised issues with the Minister ranging from the illegal sale of houses, the illegal occupation of land and houses, the size of houses, a lack of economic opportunities and access to different benefits available to veterans. Defence and Military Veterans Deputy Minister Kebby Maphatsoe, meanwhile, noted that the Human Settlements programme was being delayed by the incorrect beneficiary lists. &ldquo;The lists you submit must be cleaned up; all formations should verify the beneficiary information with South African Military Veterans Association. Some projects have stalled as a result of these unreliable lists,&rdquo; said Maphatsoe.
