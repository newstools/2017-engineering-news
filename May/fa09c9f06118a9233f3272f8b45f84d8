Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom has appointed Kyle Whitehill CEO of its newly acquired subsidiary Neotel. Liquid fully concluded its R6.55-billion buyout of Neotel in February, with plans to focus on delivering enhanced network services to enterprises and consumers. Whitehall will now be tasked with overseeing plans to make extensive upgrades and expansions to Neotel&rsquo;s network and to unlock access to high-speed, reliable connectivity across South Africa, over the next few months. He had previously served as CEO in various fast-growing telecoms markets across the Middle East, Asia and Africa, including Vodafone Ghana CEO and most recently as Vodafone Qatar CEO. &ldquo;Since leaving Vodafone, Kyle had a brief spell setting up the international arm of Ezdan Holding Group, Qatar&rsquo;s largest real estate firm,&rdquo; Liquid commented in a statement.
