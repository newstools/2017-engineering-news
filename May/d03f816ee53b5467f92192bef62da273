Africa&#39;s third-biggest oil producer Equatorial Guinea said on Thursday it had crucial support from Saudi Arabia for its bid to become a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). The country also said in a statement it would stick to commitments to cut oil production by 12 000 bbl/d. Equatorial Guinea said in January it was seeking to become Opec&#39;s fourteenth member and the sixth from Africa, an addition that would help raise the continent&#39;s influence and profile in the corridors of global oil production and pricing.
