The Gauteng provincial government hopes to raise R30-billion in funding for 31 megacity projects at the upcoming Infrastructure Funding Summit, to be held at Gallagher Estate, on Thursday and Friday. The summit is being held in partnership with the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and the Gauteng Partnership Fund (GPF), with the GPF to drive the implementation of the projects. ANC provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile on Tuesday said local government wants to build new and integrated cities and communities throughout Gauteng through various infrastructure build programmes. To fast-track the process, the private sector must come on board, he stated. &ldquo;We have realised that, to provide integrated human settlements and infrastructure broadly, we need the expertise and resources of the private sector, which is one of the reasons for hosting the summit.&rdquo; Mashatile pointed out that provincial government has set aside funding for infrastructure projects and that government will lead by example and put resources on the table. However, it wanted to encourage the private sector to work with the provincial Department of Economic Development to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to support the growth of township economies. &ldquo;We would like the private sector to source material from these economies to support and encourage the formation of small businesses,&rdquo; Mashatile said. He added that the development of megacities must also create job opportunities. &ldquo;The summit will be the beginning of a capital raising campaign. We will embark on a roadshow to raise funds for these megaprojects and the initial focus will be on the domestic market.&rdquo;
