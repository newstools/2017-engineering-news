The City of Cape Town metro on Monday issued a &ldquo;critical warning&rdquo; to water users in the Mother City. The city has warned residents to only use water for drinking, cooking and washing as dam levels drop to 21.2%, or an effective 11.2%, as the last ten% of dam water is not useable. &ldquo;The latest [daily] consumption has jumped up again to 718-million litres, which is 118-million litres over the consumption target of 600-million litres,&rdquo; a statement from the City said. &ldquo;This communication serves as a critical warning to all water users in Cape Town to cut all non-essential use of water immediately. This is not a drill.&rdquo; Mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, Xanthea Limberg, said the city had reached a critical point in the drought crisis. &ldquo;We are essentially saying that you are only allowed to use a bit of water for drinking, cooking and washing,&rdquo; said Limberg. &ldquo;Although we continue to work non-stop to force consumption down, overall use remains catastrophically high. This is not a request. We have seen huge saving-efforts, but the unseasonably hot autumn is exacerbating the situation and we must all do more.&rdquo; She advised that consumers should use no more than 100 litres of water a day. &ldquo;Stop flushing toilets when not necessary, shower for less than two minutes a day or use a wet cloth for a &lsquo;wipe-down&rsquo;, collect all would-be wasted water and use it to fill up toilet cisterns, among others.&rdquo;
