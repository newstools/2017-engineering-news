The Gautrain system will, in the next few months, go out on tender for a number of buses additional to its existing fleet, says Gautrain Management Agency CEO Jack van der Merwe. &ldquo;We would look at deploying smaller buses on additional routes, as well as some larger, more fuel-efficient buses. We would like to expand the current Gautrain bus fleet.&rdquo; Around 22 000 people make use of the Gautrain bus system per weekday. Gautrain ridership stands at 64 000 people a day. Most people prefer to drive to the Gautrain stations, and use the train from there. However, warns, Van der Merwe, &ldquo;we are building additional parking spaces but, at some point, we will run out of space and people will have to take the bus&rdquo;. The new buses will be acquired from funds saved from the current bus fleet budget, he adds. The original tender for Gautrain buses was priced per bus-kilometer travelled a day, and not per bus. The funds from kilometres not travelled belong to the GMA. Some routes have also been halted since the Gautrain&rsquo;s inception in 2010. &ldquo;We have managed to save R60-million, and will now use the funds to build a more efficient service,&rdquo; says Van der Merwe. &ldquo;We will look at additional bus routes, yes,&rdquo; he adds. &nbsp;
