Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba on Tuesday said National Treasury would support parliamentary processes aimed at regulating the South African financial sector to make the industry inclusive. &ldquo;The financial sector plays a critical role in our country, but this must be enhanced to achieve the aspirations of all South Africans. The joint standing committees on finance and trade and industry have had a number of hearings on the transformation of the financial sector,&rdquo; Gigaba said while tabling National Treasury&rsquo;s budget vote speech in Parliament. He said the committees found that the financial sector needed reinvigorating. &ldquo;We need to reinvigorate the financial sector charter to ensure all South Africans participate fully in the ownership, management, supply and take-up of financial services. Transforming the financial sector to reflect South Africa better is key, including supporting SMEs and ensuring that financial institutions procure from SMEs and emerging businesses,&rdquo; said Gigaba. The former home affairs minister said National Treasury would continue throwing its weight behind parliamentary processes which sought to make the financial sector &ldquo;fully reflect South Africa&rsquo;s demographics&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is well established that a well regulated and resilient financial system is a key foundation of any economy, and reduces the likelihood of claims on taxpayer funds to bail out failing banks and other financial institutions during times of crisis,&rdquo; said Gigaba. &ldquo;The long awaited Financial Services Regulation Bill is expected to be passed by the National Council of Provinces today, to ensure the implementation of a comprehensive system for better regulation of the financial sector.&rdquo;
