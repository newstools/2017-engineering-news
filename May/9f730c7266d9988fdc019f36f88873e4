Telekom Networks Malawi (TNM), the country&#39;s second-largest mobile network operator, said on Tuesday it is to spend an additional $30-million on improving its 4G broadband service. TNM, whose main rival is the local unit of India&#39;s Bharti Airtel, said it aimed to give better 4G coverage in Malawi&#39;s four main cities. &quot;The upgrade aims to improve the agility, speed and stability of our mobile internet services,&quot; it said in a statement. The additional spending follows an initial 9.17-billion kwacha ($12.78-million) investment which TNM made in 2016 in 4G LTE technology, coverage expansion, fixed and mobile broadband technology and various other technical improvements, it said. TNM, majority-owned by Malawian conglomerate Press Corporation, has more than 3.3-million subscribers, of a national population of about 17-million. It posted a 52% jump in net profit to 8.2-billion kwacha in 2016.
