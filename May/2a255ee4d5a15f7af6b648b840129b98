The Competition Appeal Court has dismissed Power Construction and its Western Cape subsidiary&rsquo;s appeal, based on a series of technical points, including disputing the Competition Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction and the validity of its investigation. The Competition Appeal Court on Tuesday upheld the Competition Tribunal&rsquo;s August 2016 decision that the commission&rsquo;s initiation had met all requirements for a valid initiation and, therefore, had jurisdiction to investigate a case of collusion against Power Construction. The commission had referred a case of bid rigging and collusive tendering against Power Construction and Haw and Inglis to the tribunal in December 2014. Haw and Inglis, which had been awarded the contract after colluding with Power Construction, participated in the Construction Fast Track Settlement Process and admitted liability, paying an administrative penalty of R45.3-million. This case emanated from the commission&rsquo;s investigations in the construction industry in 2009 after the commission received evidence that there was pervasive collusion in the construction sector. Subsequently, given the magnitude of the cases, the commission launched the Construction Fast Track Settlement Process in February 2011 to expedite the resolution of these cases. Under the Construction Fast Track Settlement Process, the commission has reached settlement with 22 firms found liable and the tribunal confirmed all the settlement agreements between 2013 and 2015. The combined administrative penalties levied against these firms totalled more than R1.5-billion. Following the conclusion of the settlement, the commission referred 19 cases against firms that opted not to settle, including the case against Power Construction to the tribunal. &ldquo;The Competition Appeal Court judgment paves the way for the prosecution of Power Construction before the tribunal,&rdquo; the commission said.
