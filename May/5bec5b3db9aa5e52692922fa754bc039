JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Gold mining company Randgold Resources has recorded substantially higher profit in the three months to March than in the corresponding first-quarter period last year. &ldquo;This is probably the best quarter-one we&rsquo;ve had for five years,&rdquo; Randgold Resources CEO Dr Mark Bristow told Mining Weekly Online from London. The &ldquo;above-run-rate&rdquo; output at all mines in the first three months of this year augurs well for 2017 guidance being met. Cash rose by 16% to $600-million in the first quarter, which had zero debt. Earlier this week, shareholders approved a 52% hike to $1 a share in the yearly dividend. Profit was up 33%&nbsp;on the corresponding quarter of 2016 and down 10% quarter-on-quarter against last year&rsquo;s record final quarter finish. Total cash costs an ounce were 4%&nbsp;down year-on-year and up 13% quarter-on-quarter. High recoveries supported the performance of the Loulo-Gounkoto gold mine in Mali, where the Morila tailings retreatment operation is delivering on plan, with sound cost control achieved at the Tongon mine in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire. Gold reserves have been replenished at the&nbsp;higher grade of 3.7 g/t, up from the previous 3.6 g/t, and vigorous greenfield exploration&nbsp;is being supplemented by&nbsp;exploration progress around existing mines. Year-on-year first quarter gold production was 10% higher at 322&nbsp;470&nbsp;oz; profit 33% higher at $84.9-million; and total cash costs 4% lower at $619/oz.&nbsp; But quarter-on-quarter performance failed to match last year&rsquo;s record fourth-quarter results, which turned in 15%-higher production, 10%-better profit and 13%-lower cash costs. Morila&rsquo;s Domba satellite is expected to commence operations in September this year as greenfield exploration teams deliver in line with Randgold&rsquo;s aim of developing three new mines over the next five years. Uncharacteristically, the London-listed company&rsquo;s usually stable industrial relations record was disrupted in the first three months of this year, prompting a fresh look at this aspect of the business. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rolling out a potent internal campaign designed to ensure that our distinctive DNA is fully shared by all who work here,&rdquo; said Bristow, who noted in a release to Creamer Media&rsquo;s Mining Weekly Online that the campaign would foster an inclusive culture of two-way engagement across the business. Gold reserves were boosted, in the quarter, by 520&nbsp;000 oz from Gara Far South, 475&nbsp;000 oz from Massawa in Senegal and an extension to Yalea North&rsquo;s Purple Patch, assuring Randgold of at least ten years of profitable production at a gold price of $1&nbsp;000/oz. The group&rsquo;s Kibali mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is expected to deliver 610&nbsp;000 oz of gold this year, up from 585&nbsp;946 oz in 2016. Once the DRC mine&rsquo;s underground operation is fully functional from 2018, production capacity is expected to rise to 750&nbsp;000 oz/y. Four ultrafine grind mills have been commissioned, the mine&rsquo;s second new hydropower station is now operational and construction of the third and last hydropower station is being undertaken by an all-Congolese contracting group. &ldquo;Kibali has stayed on course to become one of the world&rsquo;s great gold mines despite the volatile political climate in the DRC at present,&rdquo; said Bristow, who is intent on leading the way towards the development of the north-eastern DRC as a major new gold mining region. Meanwhile, in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, many opportunities have been confirmed for the extension of the life of Tongon, where Randgold is building a permit portfolio. The company will seek to maintain a net cash position of $500-million to provide financing flexibility should a new mine development or other growth opportunity be identified.&nbsp; It is guiding production at a rate of 1.25-million ounces of gold a year.
