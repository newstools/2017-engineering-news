Local industrial minerals and construction materials company Afrimat on Thursday reported a 25.4% increase in headline earnings a share to 196.4c for the year ended February 28, resulting from a strong performance by its mineral producing operations. The group also achieved an increase in its operating margin, from 16.3% to 18.2%, while its cash generated from operations improved from R320-million to R406-million. At a media briefing in Johannesburg, CEO Andries van Heerden noted that the addition of Cape Lime to its portfolio in the last year added 8% to Afrimat&rsquo;s operating profit. He noted that the company was also engaged in new marketing initiatives to find more markets for its products. He further pointed out that Afrimat&rsquo;s traditional business of aggregates and concrete saw a 12% improvement in operating profit, up from 32% last year to 44% this year &ndash; bolstered by &ldquo;good economics&rdquo; in the Western Cape, including infrastructure building. &ldquo;The Western Cape economy is very healthy at the moment,&rdquo; said Van Heerden, adding that efficiency improvements also contributed to its growth. Looking ahead, Van Heerden highlighted that the group was well-positioned to capitalise on its strategic initiatives and forecast continued growth from an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; asset base.
