Nelson Mandela Bay was formally declared a water disaster by Executive Mayor Athol Trollip. Th mayor formally declared the metro a disaster area on Monday after major storage dams dropped to 38.5%. At a media briefing on Wednesday, Trollip said the city faced a severe drought and had been exceptionally dry since July last year. &ldquo;We are faced with a crisis simply because a water provision canal has collapsed which has made it even more important that we save water,&rdquo;said Trollip. MMC for Safety and Security, John Best, said that a legislative process was underway for the disaster to be promulgated into the provincial gazette. &ldquo;Once the gazette is promulgated and it is published then we can apply to government for additional financial assistance. We believe the the process can take up to a week,&rdquo; said Best. MMC for Infrastructure and Engineering Annette Lovemore, urged residents to use water sparingly and said that 40 kilolitres of water per month per household was the restriction imposed. &ldquo;It is a substantial amount of water, we don&rsquo;t in anyway want to put across a message that it is okay to use 40 kl a month. It is probably okay to use between 10-15 kl per month per household at this stage,&rdquo; said Lovemore. Contractors will have to use recycled water from Fishwater Flats.
