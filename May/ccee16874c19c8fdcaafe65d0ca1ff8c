Five vessel owners who ferry passengers between the Robben Island Museum and the V&amp;A Waterfront, in Cape Town, have been referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution on charges of alleged price fixing and collusive tendering. &nbsp; This follows an investigation by the Competition Commission, after it received a complaint from the Robben Island Museum against the five respondents &ndash; Thembekile Maritime Services, Silverbuckle Trade 21, Nauticat Charters, Ferry Charters and Tigger 2 Charters. &nbsp; The respondents are all vessels owners who provide chartering services to the museum&rsquo;s clients from the V&amp;A Waterfront to Robben Island and vice versa. &nbsp; The commission&rsquo;s investigation found that, around September 22, 2015, the respondents met at the Cape Town Fish Market Coffee Shop where they discussed and agreed to increase the prices they would charge the museum when responding to a tender for bidders to be listed on the museum&rsquo;s database as preferred service providers for a 12-month period. &nbsp; The commission&rsquo;s investigation also found that, subsequent to the agreement reached at the coffee shop meeting, Thembekile and Nauticat Charters increased their prices to R18&nbsp;000 per trip for 140 passengers; Ferry Charters maintained its price at R18&nbsp;000 per trip for 140 passengers; and Silverbuckle and Tigger 2 Charters increased their prices as agreed during the coffee shop meeting, but not to the same extent as that of the other respondents, as their vessels are smaller. &nbsp;&nbsp; The commission is seeking an order from the tribunal declaring that the five respondents have contravened the Competition Act and that they are liable to pay an administrative penalty equal to 10% of their annual turnover.
