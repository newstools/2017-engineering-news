The World Bank has approved a $200-million credit for Zambia to improve rural roads in six of the southern African nation&#39;s 10 provinces, the international lender said on Monday. Zambia has a road network of 67 671 km and rural roads are in poor condition, making it difficult for small scale farmers to access markets for their produce, the World Bank said in a statement. About 7.5-million rural residents, half the population, are unconnected to the road network in Zambia, the World Bank said.
