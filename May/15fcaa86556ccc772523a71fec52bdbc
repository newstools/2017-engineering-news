State-owned freight logistics group Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) will on Tuesday begin its yearly maintenance shutdown along the key Natal Corridor (Natcor) rail line linking Gauteng to the Durban harbour. The line will operate a reduced service from May 9, but a total shutdown is planned for May 12 to 14. TFR said on Monday that it had adopted an integrated approach to the Natcor line&rsquo;s maintenance and that the May 9 to 15 shutdown would also see participation from other Transnet operating divisions including Group Capital, Port Terminals, National Ports Authority and Transnet Engineering.
