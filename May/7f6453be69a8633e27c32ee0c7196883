Although it has made &ldquo;remarkable progress&rdquo; in creating jobs over the mid-term, between May 2014 and November 2016, the Gauteng provincial government (GPG) still faced a rapid increase in the economically active population owing to migration, Premier David Makhura said in his Midterm Report on Tuesday. He cautioned that the number of jobs being created was not enough to match this influx, adding that the economy&#39;s structural problems also posed challenges, and paired with sluggish growth and the recent sovereign downgrades, posed a serious risk to the &ldquo;momentum government has been building with the private sector&rdquo;. However, the report highlighted that, through its Township Revitalisation programme, local government increased its township procurement spend from R60-million in 2014 to R6-billion in 2016, while the number of township entrepreneurs doing business with government had increased from 800 in 2015 to 2 800 in 2016. The report also shows that the Gauteng economy created around 700 000 new jobs between 2010 and 2016. Meanwhile, Makhura said infrastructure investment was one of the GPG&rsquo;s most positive trends since 2014, with the provincial government having invested R30-billion between 2013 and 2016. &ldquo;This has impacted positively on the economy and households &ndash; creating jobs, contributing to government revenue, generating additional economic activity, increasing household income and advancing economic empowerment and inclusion,&rdquo; said Makhura. The roll-out of more than 1 500 km of network fibre through the Gauteng Broadband Network project has also been a major boost for the economy with over 800 access sites having been added to the network. Household Internet connectivity has increased from 59.9% in 2014 to 65.7% in 2015. However, download speeds were behind that of other city regions.
