Djibouti has formally opened one of four new ports designed to cement the tiny Horn of Africa nation&#39;s position as a continental hub, a statement from the ports authority said on Wednesday. Doraleh Multipurpose Port has been substantially upgraded as part of a Chinese-backed plan to establish Africa&#39;s largest free-trade zone that can handle $7-billion of goods a year. &quot;The port of Djibouti is a gateway to one of the fastest growing regions of the world with 30 000 ships transiting the port each year,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Located on two of the three busiest shipping routes in the world, the port provides a strategic platform for maritime activity connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe.&quot; Tiny Djibouti, with a population of 876 000, has long punched above its weight. It hosts large US and French naval bases; China is also building a naval base. Djibouti also handles roughly 95% of the inbound trade for neighbouring Ethiopia, population 99-million. Doraleh&#39;s bulk terminal can handle two-million tons of cargo a year, and offers space to store 100 000 t of fertiliser, 100 000 t of grain, and warehouses for other goods. The break bulk terminal can handle six-million tons of cargo annually, the statement said, and there are 40 000 slots for vehicles at the RO-RO terminal. Two other ports designed to export salt and potash will open next month. Djibouti mainly handles goods from Asia, representing nearly 60% of traffic, the statement said. In 2015, overall traffic to Djibouti increased 20% to 5.7-million tonnes.
