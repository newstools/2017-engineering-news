Open-access infrastructure and connectivity provider FibreCo on Wednesday officially opened its hosting facility, adjacent to the West Africa Cable System (WACS) landing station in Yzerfontein, Western Cape. The open-access hosting and co-location facilities, which connected directly into the undersea cable landing station (CLS), unlocked flexibility for WACS to manage its own routing protection. Overcoming current CLS hosting challenges, FibreCo also enabled end customer network interfaces directly from the CLS, said FibreCo chief technical officer Marius Mostert in a statement on Wednesday. &ldquo;In addition, the hosting facility is an aggregation point for the developing surrounding areas of Yzerfontein,&rdquo; he added. FibreCo is also introducing energy efficient enhancements at the site owing to the area&rsquo;s environmental sensitivity. &ldquo;As FibreCo continues to expand its facility footprint, there is an associated focus on sustainability and energy-efficiency initiatives to reduce energy consumption by incorporating the latest efficient technologies and practices in data centre management to minimise environmental impact,&rdquo; Mostert explained.
