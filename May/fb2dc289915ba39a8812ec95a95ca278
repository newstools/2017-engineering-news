The Nuclear Industry Association of South Africa (Niasa) will, in due course, announce a successor to nuclear physicist Dr Rob Adam, who retired last week as president. Adam, who served as Niasa president for the past decade, is currently SKA telescope project CEO and a past South African Nuclear Energy Cooperation CEO. Niasa manages lobby and advocacy work on behalf of key local and international nuclear technology vendors.
