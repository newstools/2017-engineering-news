Malawi&rsquo;s Blantyre Water Board (BWB) has shortlisted four bidders for a project to tap water from the Likhubula river to the city, the country&rsquo;s commercial capital. The project will be financed by a $23-million loan from the Export and Import (Exim) Bank of India. BWB CEO Henry Bakuwa says the four shortlisted bidders comprise a joint venture of WPIL and SMS Paryavaran, Megha Engineering &amp; Infrastructure, SMC Infrastructure and Technafab Engineering. Bakuwa reports that the four bidders were selected after Exim Bank had scrutinised ten applications from several interested contractors. The main components of the project include the construction of an intake structure on the Likhubula river; the laying of a 50&nbsp;km pipeline from the river to Nguludi, which is close to the city of Blantyre; the construction of a storage tank at Mpingwe Hill, in the city; and the laying of supply mains from the storage tank to two locations in the city. &ldquo;The importance of [this project] cannot be overemphasised. Firstly, it will supplement the existing water supply systems by adding 20 000 m3 (20-milllion litres) of water a day, thus meeting the present demand for water,&rdquo; says Bakuwa. &ldquo;Secondly, it will assist in reducing exorbitant electricity costs, as the system will largely be operated under gravity &ndash; specifically, the raw water transmission mains.&rdquo; The project is aimed at curbing water shortages in Blantyre, which are the result of increasing demand caused by rapid population growth. Malawi will also implement a project to tap water from Lake Malawi to supply the city of Lilongwe. The contract for the project has been awarded to South Africa-based Katho Civils in a restricted tendering process.
