The world&rsquo;s largest standard production tractor, the Fendt 1000 Vario, has this week been launched to the South African market by US agriculture equipment distributor Agco during agriculture trade fair Nampo, held in Bothaville, in the Free State. In addition to the Fendt 1000 Vario, the German tractor brand was also launched to the domestic and broader African region during the expo, with the addition of another three tractors &ndash; the Fendt 200 Vario V, Fendt 700 Vario and Fendt 900 Vario series. Agco senior VP Gary Collar tells Engineering News Online that the Fendt 1000 Vario tractor was made available to the domestic market to advance large commercial farms in South Africa by availing the latest and best commercial-scale technology to help modernise farms. Agco Africa VP Nuradin Osman adds that the introduction of the Fendt brand in South Africa is an important step for Agco and also a positive sign for future agricultural development in South Africa. &ldquo;South Africa was the natural choice for launching this important brand on the continent. For years, Fendt tractors have been setting standards in efficiency and performance in Europe and this is what South African farmers demand as well.&rdquo; The Fendt 1000 Vario features more than 500 hp and uses large tyres, coupled with intelligent ballasting and tyre pressure assistants, as well as unique, variable four-wheel drive to deliver enhanced traction and pulling power for large-scale operations.
