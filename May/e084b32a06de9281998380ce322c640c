Entries for the Engen Engine Restoration Challenge 2017 are now open. Engen is partnering with the South African Federation of Vintage Tractor and Engine Clubs (Savtec) to invite budding mechanics to take part in this exciting initiative. Following last year&rsquo;s inaugural competition, this year&rsquo;s entrants stand the chance to win a share of R200 000 for the best restoration of a vintage engine back to full operational status. &ldquo;Engen&rsquo;s long heritage within the agricultural sector is built on a tradition of quality that has seen the company consistently recognised as the preferred fuels and lubricants brand for farmers in South Africa,&rdquo; Engen lubricant national sales manager Paul Leask says. He adds that Engen, along with Savtec, continues to embrace the opportunity to transfer and develop mechanical skills through the mentorship elements of the competition. &ldquo;In the process, we can develop a culture favouring preservation of, and respect for, the vintage equipment used to develop the agricultural sector.&rdquo; Entries for the junior and senior class categories opened in May and will close on November 30. The winners will be announced&nbsp;in 2018.
