Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies will launch the first phase of the revitalised Vulindlela Heights industrial park, in Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, on May 15. The first phase of&nbsp;the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s (DTI&rsquo;s) Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme focuses on the security infrastructure upgrades, fencing, street lighting and critical electricity requirements. Vulindlela&rsquo;s launch marks a significant milestone in the implementation of the programme which is part of the Industrial Policy Action Plan (Ipap). &ldquo;The multimillion-rand programme is also in line with&nbsp;the DTI&rsquo;s economic transformation initiatives to ensure that all regions and enterprises participate meaningfully in the mainstream economy,&rdquo; Davies said. He emphasized that&nbsp;the parks are catalysts for broader economic and industrial development in their host regions. &ldquo;They also contribute to economic growth, diversification of economic activity, attracting investments, job creation and addressing inequality.&rdquo; Vulindlela Heights will be the second industrial park to be launched in the Eastern Cape after the completion of the first phase of revitalisation.
