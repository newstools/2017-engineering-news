The Eskom Research, Testing and Development (RT&amp;D) unit is building a MicroGrid technology demonstration plant in a rural unelectrified village, near Ficksburg, in the Free State. &ldquo;This project is a demonstration of next-horizon technology that supports Eskom&rsquo;s future strategic objectives, as well as solving the energy challenges that we face as a country,&rdquo; said RT&amp;D GM Barry MacColl. The project is being rolled out in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the community of Wilhelmina farm and Eskom RT&amp;D&rsquo;s Smart Grid Centre of Excellence. &ldquo;The microgrid being deployed is a combination of renewable energy, energy storage, smart metering infrastructure and telecommunications systems, designed to function as a reliable source of electricity for the community,&rdquo; MacColl said.&nbsp; The system is expected to be operational by end-August.
