The pending acquisition of a 35% stake in Kenya&rsquo;s largest telecoms group Safaricom will secure JSE-listed Vodacom a high-growth market that is as large as all of its international subsidiaries combined. The R35-billion deal, expected to be concluded in August, presented South Africa&rsquo;s largest telecoms group upside potential for further mobile penetration and data growth in the fast-growing Kenya market, as well as that of its East African neighbours. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub, presenting the group&rsquo;s 2017 financial year-end results at the JSE on Monday, explained that Safaricom offered exciting and strong ongoing growth opportunities, particularly as, with a total population of 45-million, Kenya only had a mobile penetration rate of 88%. Safaricom, with a 71% mobile customer market share, boasted 28.1-million of these customers, the base of which increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% over the last five years. Some 69% of Kenya&rsquo;s mobile customers were using data, with Safaricom&rsquo;s well-invested network infrastructure and spectrum portfolio boasting second-generation mobile coverage of 95%, third-generation of 85% and fourth-generation of 25%. Further, the success of M-pesa, currently generating 27% of service revenue and used by 79%, or 19-million, of its mobile customers in the region, could be replicated across other Vodacom territories. Safaricom&rsquo;s M-pesa customer base reported a 15.9% five-year CAGR. Safaricom&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong historic operational performance&quot; is expected to continue &ndash; the group recorded an average revenue per user CAGR of 6.6% over the last five years, along with a double-digit 14.8% revenue CAGR and a 48% adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin. Vodacom&rsquo;s interest in Safaricom will contribute about 15% of its earnings before amortisation for the fair value adjustment of assets on acquisition. While Safaricom is &ldquo;highly complementary&rdquo; to Vodacom&rsquo;s existing footprint, the move will also significantly diversify Vodacom&rsquo;s revenue growth and profitability with a stronger regional presence in East Africa to drive regional and Pan-African enterprise propositions and solutions. &ldquo;The proposed transaction offers an opportunity to diversify Vodacom&rsquo;s economic exposure and earning&rsquo;s profile in a single transaction,&rdquo; Joosub said. To complete the acquisition, Vodacom will issue its parent company Vodafone Group with 226.8-million new ordinary shares, which priced at R152.49 at close of day on Friday &ndash; a 5.9% discount to Safaricom&rsquo;s share price on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. Following the conclusion of the transaction, Vodacom will be entitled to appoint three directors to the board. Kenya&rsquo;s government owns 35% of Safaricom, while public investors and Safaricom employees hold 25% and 0.07% respectively. Vodafone will retain a 12.5% shareholding in Vodafone Kenya. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
