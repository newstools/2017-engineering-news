Through &ldquo;sweating its assets&rdquo;, JSE-listed Dipula Income Fund achieved 9.5% organic growth in its distributable earnings for the six months ended February 28, to R194.2-million, which further resulted in an increase in combined dividends a share of 6.3%. The dividend attributable to A-shares increased by 5% over the prior period to 50.6c apiece, while the dividend attributable to B-shares increased by 7.9% to 41.8c apiece. Vacancies remained at 9.2% compared with the prior period. &ldquo;This is owing to the challenging market conditions, particularly in the office sector, where vacancies increased from 11.7% in the prior period to 15.1% at reporting date,&rdquo; the fund stated. Industrial vacancies reduced significantly to 8.8% from 11.5%, while retail vacancies increased marginally from 7.6% in February 2016 to 7.9% at February 28, this year. &ldquo;The current economic environment is one of almost no growth, which has a significant impact on the property sector. The ability to lease new space or expand existing tenants is greatly reduced. &ldquo;We expect the current economic conditions to continue in the short- to medium-term and we will continue to focus on extracting the maximum value from the portfolio and reducing the vacancy factor,&rdquo; Dipula highlighted. Reflecting the challenging environment, the board expects growth in distributions of between 5% and 6.5% for the financial year ending August 31. &ldquo;This growth assumes that macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate further, no major corporate failures occur and that tenants will be able to absorb rising utility and assessment rates costs,&rdquo; Dipula added.
