South Africa&#39;s President Jacob Zuma said on Friday he was not opposed to setting up a commission of inquiry into corruption into his government after an anti-graft report alleged he was influenced by the wealthy Gupta family in making government appointments. The former Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated corruption watchdog, called for a commission of inquiry in the &quot;State of Capture&quot; report into alleged influence-peddling. The report was released in November. Zuma has challenged the report in court, arguing that the Public Protector had no right to ask him to form a commission in the manner the Public Protector recommended, as it was the president&#39;s prerogative. In a statement from his office on Friday, Zuma said he was not opposed to such an inquiry, but did not say when such a commission could be established.
