JSE-listed Nampak achieved an 8% increase in headline earnings per share (HEPS) to 111.1c and a 15% increase in earnings per share to 120.8c for the half-year ended March 31. Speaking during a presentation of the company&rsquo;s results, CEO Andre de Ruyter said the company continued to focus on managing and improving controllable aspects such as costs, asset performance and processes, resulting in R70-million in savings for the period. &ldquo;Capital expenditure of R470-million was tightly controlled and 49% lower, with significantly improved project management capability,&rdquo; he said, highlighting that net profit had increased by 41% during the period. He pointed out that the asset recapitalisation programme in South Africa was almost complete and was already contributing to improved efficiencies and competitiveness. &nbsp; &ldquo;The substantially strengthened balance sheet has significantly enhanced our ability to be resilient during continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Net gearing of 51% is within our target range and short-term liquidity ratios are strong,&rdquo; he said. De Ruyter added that adequate funding facilities were available internationally and locally, and the group remained comfortably within its debt covenants.&nbsp; Group revenue&nbsp;of R9.3-billion was 1% lower, despite a 10% stronger average rand/dollar exchange rate that negatively impacted on the translation of contributions from foreign operations. Strong revenue growth of 11% was achieved by the metals division, owing to robust beverage can sales in Angola and improved volumes from Bevcan South Africa. This was offset by a poor performance from the UK plastics business, where a turnaround plan is being led by a new management team. Most markets in the paper division had lower demand, while the glass division delivered subdued performance, owing to softer demand in the South African market.&nbsp; &nbsp; The group trading margin rose to 11.9%, driven by stronger trading profit from the metals division. Operating profit improved by 30% to R1.1-billion, assisted by net abnormal gains of R24-million compared to net abnormal losses of R119-million in the prior year.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The net working capital cycle absorbed R912-million, mainly owing to R223-million invested in inventory because of higher volumes in Angola, compared with a release of R169-million in the prior year. South Africa experienced volatile exchange rates, slow growth rates and lower consumer demand on the back of low commodity prices and heightened political uncertainty. &ldquo;Despite these conditions, revenue and trading profit increased by 3% and 7% respectively.&nbsp; The region&rsquo;s contribution to trading profit was 45%.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest of Africa recorded sales of R2.9-billion, up 5%, while trading profit rose by 32%. The rest of Africa now contributes 55% to trading profit, up from 47% in 2016.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because of liquidity constraints in Nigeria and Angola, cash extraction from those countries has been a key focus area where we have been able to successfully reduce our exposure through active hedging programmes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Further progress has been made in the extraction of cash from Nigeria with at least $54-million in cash extraction expected to be achieved before the financial year-end, further strengthening the group&rsquo;s ability to fund the rest of Africa growth markets.&rdquo; Cash held in Nigeria and Angola increased to R2.4-billion owing to strong cash generation. The combined cash extraction rate from these countries improved to 80%, and 61% of cash was hedged as at March 31.&nbsp; &nbsp; In view of the current risks and challenges, the company has not declared an interim ordinary dividend, rather focusing efforts on conserving cash.
