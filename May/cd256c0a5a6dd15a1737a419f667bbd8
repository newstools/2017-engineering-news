Johannesburg&rsquo;s City Power on Monday said customers who have illegally tampered with their electricity meters have an opportunity to claim amnesty and normalise their meters &ldquo;no questions asked&rdquo;, but only until June 30. Customers approaching City Power during the amnesty period to &ldquo;register&rdquo; the tampered meter will avoid being penalised through reconnection fees and average monthly consumption charges, and will have the meter reset free of charge. &ldquo;Meter tampering constitutes fraud and may result in criminal charges. Customers will be held liable and no mercy [will be] shown to those found to have tampered with their meters, after June 30, when the amnesty period ends,&rdquo; said member of the Infrastructure, Environment and Services MMC Councillor Nico de Jager. City Power described meter tampering as &ldquo;any action resulting in the breaking of a seal, the opening, adjustment or removal of a meter, bypassing a meter, opening of a meter box or interfering with the meter or municipal wiring, piping or other installations in any manner&rdquo;. It is expected that customers will save some R11 230, taking into account the reconnection fee and the average monthly consumption fee for a low-income household, if they came forward now. &ldquo;Failing which, not only will criminal charges be brought against them, but the meter [will be] disconnected and removed and a new meter installed after payment of a considerable amount of money,&rdquo; De Jager warned.
