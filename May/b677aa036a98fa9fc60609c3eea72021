The Department of Trade and Industry has spent R42-million on security upgrades at the Babelegi industrial park, in Hammanskraal, which included the installation of invisible fencing, a control room, guard houses, swing gates and pedestrian gates, a new boom gate and high-mast lighting upgrades and maintenance. Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies will launch the revitalised industrial park, which forms part of the department&rsquo;s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme, next week. The programme aims to accelerate economic development in lagging regions by attracting business investments to these areas, while supporting job creation in manufacturing and related sectors. The Babelegi industrial park has 261 developed units that are available for leasing, with 188 of the units occupied by firms operating in textiles, engineering, construction, light manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.
