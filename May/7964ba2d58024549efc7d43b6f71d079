JSE-listed Jasco Electronics has acquired a majority 51% stake in Johannesburg-based information technology (IT) managed services group Reflex Solutions for R39.8-million. The acquisition of Reflex, which recently expanded into fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) solutions, adding to a portfolio of hosted IT infrastructure and cloud services, would lift Jasco up the value chain towards a higher-margin professional service and annuity-based offering. &ldquo;This acquisition is another step in the group&rsquo;s strategy of measured acquisitions that either bulk up existing business units or fill gaps in our portfolio to supplement organic growth,&rdquo; explained Jasco CEO Pete da Silva. The move would boost Jasco&rsquo;s enterprise offering in the blue-chip corporate market; enhance its existing customer base within the retail, logistics, education, telecommunications and financial services industry; and would assist the group in breaking into the lucrative FTTH growth market. Reflex&rsquo;s operations cover Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban, with a double-digit revenue growth record since 2014 and consistent operating margins above 10%. The current management team and founder will stay with the company for at least two years.
