AfriBusiness has launched an application against Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to request the court to set the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA) regulations aside and declare it invalid. The business watchdog said on Wednesday that the PPPFA restrictions placed upon businesses, particularly the preselection criteria, excluded most &ndash; if not all &ndash; white-owned businesses. &ldquo;It is next to impossible for white-owned businesses to comply with all of the said regulations and obtain tenders from the State,&rdquo; the organisation said in a statement. AfriBusiness manager Charles Castle noted that the business sector, as a collective, needed to &ldquo;fight for the abolishment of all racially discriminatory legislation&rdquo;. &ldquo;We cannot allow the current government to continue with its discrimination against citizens based on the colour of their skin. Government will cause more unemployment and job insecurity due to the implementation of these draconian provisions.
