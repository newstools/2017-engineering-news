Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Minister Anton Bredell has renewed the call on consumers to do even more to save water, after the average water level for dams across the province dropped to 20% on Monday. &ldquo;In the remaining period before our expected rainfall season, we must do what we can to use even less water. Consumers have been very cooperative and responded well to our calls to save water, but an even bigger effort is needed to ensure we don&rsquo;t run out altogether,&rdquo; he said. Bredell added that departments are meeting with all stakeholders, including national government departments on a regular basis, to assess the ongoing situation and to devise strategies to tackle water shortages in the longer term. He has cautioned the public to continue to use water sparingly when it does start to rain. &ldquo;Our disaster management team in the province also remains on alert.&rdquo;
