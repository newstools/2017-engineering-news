South Africa&#39;s Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Monday the treasury would use its R500-billion ($40-billion) annual procurement budget to transform the economy and give more support to black-owned businesses. &quot;The strategic use of state procurement is an important lever to grow black business,&quot; Gigaba told a business dinner in Johannesburg. &quot;The State getting value for money is important but this aim should be considered in conjunction with our economic history.&quot; Gigaba, appointed after President Jacob Zuma sacked his predecessor, has backed Zuma&#39;s aim of redistributing wealth to poor blacks but said this would not involve a shift away from the fiscal consolidation outlined in recent budgets.
