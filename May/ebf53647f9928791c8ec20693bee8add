Telecommunications equipment and network solutions provider ZTE has entered a new broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) partnership with 100% black women-owned enterprise Saldomax Technologies. The new alliance aimed to affirm ZTE&rsquo;s compliance and commitment to South Africa&rsquo;s development imperatives and create an enabling environment for economic transformation, said ZTE South Africa chairperson and CEO Liu Haishi on Wednesday. &ldquo;We are moving into a new era and our focus is to grow relationships and extend our footprint in the South African market,&rdquo; he added, pointing to further corporate social responsibility initiatives that are in the pipeline to demonstrate the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;commitment to South Africa and the development of its economy and people&rdquo;. Meanwhile, ZTE unveiled plans to move its corporate headquarters into a new 3 500 m2 Johannesburg facility in June. &ldquo;The new headquarters will be large enough to accommodate our growth plans and will house additional resources including a research and development facility. Obviously, this move will also bring further employment opportunities with ZTE and, as such, endorse our commitment to the local market,&rdquo; Haishi concluded.
