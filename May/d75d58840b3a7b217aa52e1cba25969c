Heineken South Africa has awarded Aveng Grinaker-LTA&rsquo;s building division a two-phase contract for Project Harvest at the Sedibeng Brewery, in Midvaal, Gauteng. The project includes the expansion of the cider production facilities through the addition of new cider base tanks (CBTs) and the construction of a flavouring plant with cold storage facilities, dissolved sugar tanks with dry storage facilities, a yeast propagation plant and bright beer tanks (BBTs). &ldquo;The expansion of the Sedibeng Brewery plant is in line with Heineken South Africa&rsquo;s strategic optimisation for planning, networking and operations, and must be executed with minimum impact to current service levels at the plant,&rdquo; said Aveng MD Chris Botha. Aveng is responsible for the two phases, the first of which comprises the civil and concrete rafts for the yeast plant, CBT and BBT, which is expected to take two months to complete. Phase 2 will see the completion of the yeast propagation plant, CBT, BBT and flavour room, as well as the cold and dry storage facilities within a four-and-a-half-month period.
