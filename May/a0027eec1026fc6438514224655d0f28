The Earth Observation (EO) Directorate of the South African National Space Agency (Sansa) has developed an advanced crop-monitoring system for South Africa that will also be made available to other African countries, in due course. &ldquo;We are able to monitor their [the crops&rsquo;] condition through time,&rdquo; Sansa EO acting MD Dr Paida Mangara told the thirty-seventh International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment (ISRSE) in Pretoria. &ldquo;We want to implement it throughout the African region through our cooperation with Nepad,&rdquo; he told Engineering News Online. &ldquo;Currently, there are five countries which will pilot the system. We are developing the implementation plan, starting with these five countries.&rdquo; Their names will be released at a later date, jointly with Nepad. Resource management and the environment form a major focus area for Sansa, and the crop-monitoring programme is in line with the agency&rsquo;s strategic aim of maximising space science and technology for socioeconomic benefit. A top priority is the provision of space-based data, products and services. &ldquo;We have to transform Terabytes of EO data into understandable and useable information,&rdquo; he highlighted at ISRSE. &ldquo;That is where our key focus is, at the moment.&rdquo; To this end, Sansa has its own EO data centre, and the agency is looking at developing a high performance computing centre for EO. Currently, there is no problem with access to most space-based data, especially medium-resolution imagery. Much of this is now available for free. &ldquo;Where we have challenges are areas in which high resolution [imagery] is required,&rdquo; he stated. High resolution means a resolution of less than 1 m; this has to be paid for. South Africa&rsquo;s next satellite, EOSat-1, will have a maximum resolution of about 2.5 m. &ldquo;Its primary mission is food security &ndash; agricultural crop and grazing lands monitoring,&rdquo; he explained to Engineering News Online. &ldquo;The secondary mission is to track land use &ndash; land cover monitoring, looking at built-up environments (settlements, urban areas in general), different land-use types, and also monitoring vegetation, soils and water. A third mission is disaster management. We aim to complete the flight model EOSat-1 in the 2019/20 period.
