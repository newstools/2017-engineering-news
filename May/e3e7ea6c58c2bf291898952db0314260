The Black Business Council (BBC) and Business Unity South Africa (Busa) have walked away from a long-standing partnership after a BBC delegation was kicked out of a National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) Infrastructure Committee meeting two weeks ago by a Busa delegation. The 23-year-old partnership within Nedlac soured last week, with Busa president Jabu Mabuza stating that the organisation would end the arrangement with BBC after a lapse in the 2012 to 2015 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the parties and the failure to agree to the terms of a new framework for participation. The MoU provided a cooperative framework to promote the interests of business at Nedlac and enabled BBC representatives to participate in Nedlac proceedings through Busa. Busa stated it would continue to represent the interests of the business constituency in Nedlac &ldquo;as the sole recognised voice of business&rdquo; and remained committed to working with all organised business formations and stakeholders, including the BBC. While the split meant that the BBC would no longer be represented through Busa at Nedlac, this did not prevent the BBC from seeking direct access in Nedlac, Busa pointed out. BBC president Danisa Baloyi said in a statement that the BBC would continue participating in Nedlac as an independent voice of black business. &ldquo;We believe this will provide a great opportunity for the BBC to advocate the aspirations of our people,&rdquo; she added.
