South African car buyers had access to 55 passenger car brands in 2016, with 3 458 model derivatives to choose from, says National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) executive manager Dr Norman Lamprecht. &ldquo;This afforded car buyers the widest choice to market-size ratio anywhere in the world.&rdquo; In the light commercial vehicle market, there were 36 brands to choose from, and 739 derivatives. In 2015, there were 55 passenger brands and 2 872 passenger car derivatives available in South Africa, as well as 31 light commercial vehicle brands, and 625 model derivatives. Lamprecht recently launched the Automotive Export Manual 2017 in Pretoria. The manual provides information on the local automotive industry, which is South Africa&rsquo;s largest manufacturing sector. Lamprecht notes that South Africa had a vehicle parc of 11.96-million registered vehicles in 2016, of which 7-million vehicles were passenger cars. The total vehicle parc numbered 10.6-million vehicles in 2012, and 8.58-million in 2009, meaning South Africa has added roughly 3.5-million new vehicles to its roads over the last eight years. The average age of the 2016 passenger vehicle parc was 9 years and 5 months, and for the total parc, 9 years and 6 months. 2016 Top Ten The top ten most popular vehicles sold in South Africa in 2016 included nine locally made models, and one imported model. The imported vehicle was the India-made Toyota Etios, with the other nine the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, Toyota Quantum, Nissan NP200, Isuzu KB, Chevrolet Utility, Volkswagen Polo,Volkswagen Polo Vivo and Toyota Corolla/Corolla Quest. Toyota had the biggest market share in South Africa in 2016 in terms of new-vehicle sales, at 21.4%, followed by Volkswagen/Audi, at 15.8%, and Ford, at 13.5%. Diesel vs Petrol The popularity of diesel vehicles in South Africa has been growing steadily, notes Lamprecht. In 2016, the share of new diesel passenger car and light commercial vehicle sales reached 33.5% of total sales, up from 32.2% in 2015, and 25.9% in 2012. The 2016 percentage remains low, however, in contrast with Western Europe, where diesel engines made up 49.5% of passenger car sales in 2016. Hybrids, Electric Vehicles South Africans are still shy to buy so-called green vehicles, with domestic hybrid petrol and diesel vehicle sales reaching 574 units in 2016. Electric cars sales reached 41 units in 2016, down from 79 units in 2015. Economic Contribution The total automotive industry in 2016 contributed 7.4% to South Africa&rsquo;s gross domestic product. Vehicle and component production made up 33% of South Africa&rsquo;s manufacturing output. Capital expenditure by vehicle and component manufacturers reached R9-billion in 2016. Two Worrying Trends South Africa was responsible for 58.5% of African vehicle production in 2016, down from 64% in 2015. South Africa&rsquo;s global vehicle production share dropped to 0.63%, down from 0.68% in 2015. This means South Africa is diminishing in importance as a global and African source country. Only increased volume will solve the problem. Exports and Imports South Africa&rsquo;s total automotive export earnings, including vehicles and components, last year increased to R171-billion, up from R151.5-billion in 2015. Total automotive imports, including vehicles, parts for assembly and aftermarket parts, reached R204-billion, up from R196.7-billion in 2015. Germany was South Africa&rsquo;s top vehicle export destination by value, with the UK taking top spot in volume terms. Germany was also South Africa&rsquo;s top country of origin for all automotive imports, by value, in 2016, with the India the top country of origin for vehicle imports. Eastern Cape Number One Gauteng had the most automotive companies in the country as a region, at 200 firms. Gauteng is also home to 38.6% of South Africa&rsquo;s vehicle parc. Just more than 34% of all new passenger cars sold in South Africa in 2016 were sold in Gauteng, 32.8% of all light commercial vehicles, and 37% of all trucks. The Eastern Cape, however, emerged as South Africa&rsquo;s top vehicle producer and exporter in 2016, with 47% of light vehicles produced in South Africa in 2016 made in this province, and with the province responsible for 52.6% of all light vehicle exports from South Africa. In 2012, the province was responsible for 38.4% of all light vehicle exports from South Africa. The numbers were most likely buoyed by increasing exports from Mercedes-Benz South Africa and Volkswagen Group South Africa. &nbsp;
