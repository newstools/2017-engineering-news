Nissan South Africa (SA)&nbsp;hopes to make an announcement this year&nbsp;on the production of any new model/models at its Rosslyn plant, in Pretoria, says MD Mike Whitfield. He declines to note the model/s that could be produced at the plant. Japanese carmaker Nissan in 2013 postponed its plan, announced in 2012, to start production of a new one-ton pick-up at the Rosslyn facility in 2014. No investment decision has been announced since. It was widely expected that Nissan SA would produce the new Navara pickup. However, the pickup has been launched in the international market with no mention of production in South Africa. Vehicle assembly at Rosslyn has dropped from around 55&nbsp;000 units in 2014, to roughly 30&nbsp;000 units last year. The plant produces the NP200 half-ton bakkie, as well as the NP300 Hardbody one-ton bakkie. It is likely that production of these models will continue beyond any investment decision. Whitfield says Nissan SA&rsquo;s parent remains committed to South Africa. He adds that the Rosslyn plant &ldquo;has never been in better shape&rdquo; in terms of quality and efficiency. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.&rdquo; US carmaker General Motors earlier this month shocked the local automotive industry when it announced that it will pull out of South Africa by the end of the year. Production at General Motors South Africa plant last year reached around 34 000 units.
