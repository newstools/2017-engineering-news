Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba on Monday appointed Dondo Mogajane as acting director-general, effective May 16, after Lungisa Fuzile completed his notice period. Mogajane would act in the position &ldquo;until the process of appointing a new director-general is completed&rdquo;. Gigaba has indicated previously that he intends appointing a permanent replacement for Fuzile, who confirmed that he would be leaving the department within days of President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s March 31 Cabinet reshuffle, by the end of May. Mogajane&#39;s name has emerged as a possible candidate. Mogajane has worked in various areas at the National Treasury since 1999, most recently serving as deputy director-general responsible for the Public Finance division. Between 2007 and 2010, he represented South Africa at the Executive Board of the World Bank as senior adviser for Africa Group 1 countries. Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan appointed Mogajane as the chief of staff in the Ministry of Finance between 2010 and 2014 and he subsequently acted as Chief Operating Officer of the National Treasury from 2014 until June 2015. &ldquo;Mr Mogajane&rsquo;s appointment is with effect from 16 May 2017 until the process of appointing a new director-general is completed,&rdquo; the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Gigaba expressed gratitude to Fuzile for his service to the National Treasury and the country saying that, in the past month, he had &ldquo;facilitated a successful and smooth handover&rdquo; to Gigaba and Deputy Minister Sfiso Buthelezi. &ldquo;Director-general Fuzile is a model public servant who has devoted 19 years to the service of our country. He leaves behind a legacy of a strong National Treasury that has a formidable team as well as a strong institutional framework that will carry forward the mandate of the department. As he departs today, we wish him all success in his future endeavours,&rdquo; Gigaba said.
