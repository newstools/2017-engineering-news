Interventions by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in the Ngaka Modiri Molema, Tswaing, Ditsobotla, Ramotshere, Mahikeng and Ratlou municipalities are yielding positive results, with the implementation of several projects to ensure adequate service delivery. The DWS is upgrading the water infrastructure system in those municipalities to cater for the increasing demands of communities. In Ratlou, for instance, the DWS has set aside R70-million for the Ratlou master plan project, which will result in the drilling of new boreholes, the erection of pump houses, the refurbishment and equipping of existing boreholes, the installation of water meters and the construction of a 35 km pipeline for delivering potable water.&nbsp; &ldquo;The pipe-jacking process has been completed, while the reservoir is 84% complete and progress made on the construction of the 35 km pipeline stands at 65%.&rdquo;
