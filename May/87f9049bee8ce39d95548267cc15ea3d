From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. US borescope manufacturer Gradient Lens Corporation&rsquo;s new Hawkeye V2 flexible video borescopes are in demand in South Africa&rsquo;s technical industries where they support efficient, documented non-destructive testing and inspection. Schalk Burger has the story. Schalk Burger: The Hawkeye rigid and flexible borescopes are widely used in South Africa for many small and large engineering applications, including for quality assurance inspection, gunsmithing, arms manufacturers, petrochemicals industries and maintenance inspections, among others. The firm&rsquo;s new flexible V2 videoscopes, which are available in 4mm and 6mm diameter sizes and up to 6 m in length, are growing in demand in the local market. The videoscopes are used in the aerospace, energy, wind generation, manufacturing, automotive and technical maintenance fields. Local reseller GP Agencies sales manager Lesley Scott explains some of the industries where the borescopes are used and highlights new demand and new industries that are using borescopes. Sales manager Lesley Scott: Schalk Burger: The Hawkeye borescopes are well suited to the local market and in high demand in South Africa owing to their competitive pricing compared to other borescope manufacturers and their consistent image quality. Scott highlights that the company can make custom borescopes for clients, but will do so only if the image quality is not affected and remains within industrial quality limits.
