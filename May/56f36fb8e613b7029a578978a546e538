JSE-listed construction company Group Five has appointed Themba Mosai, who has been acting CEO of the group since March, as CEO, effective immediately. He takes over the reins from Eric Vemer, who moved on to new opportunities. Mosai has been with Group Five for over 13 years, three of which have been on the group executive committee (Exco). The company noted that Mosai was instrumental in the growth of the developments business, which focused on the identification of significant contract opportunities in the target sectors of transport, energy and real estate. Mosai said the company would continue focusing on improving performance across its portfolio. &ldquo;Our immediate priorities are to deliver stakeholder value by rightsizing our construction business, effectively managing risk, executing on the voluntary rebuild programme and leveraging our relationship with Aberdeen Infrastructure Fund to expand our concessions business.&rdquo; Group Five also appointed Kushil Maharaj as group Exco member of investment and concessions (I&amp;C). Maharaj has extensive experience in real estate deal structuring and development, infrastructure development and construction management. He worked in various roles in Group Five&rsquo;s engineering and construction cluster for ten years before moving to the I&amp;C cluster in 2004.
