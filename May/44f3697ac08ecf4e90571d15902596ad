JSE-listed construction firm Group Five has warned of a possible board shake-up. The company on Thursday said a shareholder had notified it that it will seek to call an extraordinary general meeting to call for the reconstitution of Group Five&rsquo;s board of directors, following a disagreement with the board on the future direction of the company. Group Five earlier this month announced that it has split its lossmaking Engineering &amp; Construction (E&amp;C) cluster as part of its restructure to deliver more focused businesses with appropriate resources and cost bases relevant to the regions and service offerings provided. The poor performance of the E&amp;C business had contributed to Group Five posting a R343-million operating loss for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The company has also embarked on a retrenchment process to right-size the company. Eric Vemer resigned as CEO of the group in February, with the process to appoint a successor still under way.
