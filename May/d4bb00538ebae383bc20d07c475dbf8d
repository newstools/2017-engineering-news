The South African government will start renegotiating its inter-governmental agreements on nuclear cooperation with five nations, Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi said on Friday. This comes after the government decided last week not to appeal a high court ruling that effectively halted procurement of new nuclear plants. &ldquo;In terms of the timeframes for the nuclear new build programme, we are starting with the work in June,&rdquo; she told a media briefing after her budget vote speech to the National Assembly. &ldquo;We are restarting the process. We are signing new agreements. For me it does not make sense to take a 1995 agreement &hellip; The five of them &ndash; China, Russia, France, US, South Korea &ndash; we will renegotiate new agreements.&rdquo; Kubayi said she could not say how long it would take before Eskom could return to the market with a request for information after that issued in December was invalidated by the Cape Town High Court. &ldquo;To commit to a timeframe now, I would be shooting myself in the foot.&rdquo;
