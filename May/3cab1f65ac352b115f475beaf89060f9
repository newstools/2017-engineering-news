The Homo naledi hominin species, first described in 2015, has been found to have coexisted in sub-equatorial Africa with other hominin species and was likely present in the same general region as the Homo sapiens species &ndash; the direct ancestors of modern humans &ndash; scientists revealed on Tuesday. A new and remarkably complete fossil of Homo naledi, called Neo &ndash; Gift in seSotho &ndash; was on Tuesday unveiled, along with the age of the Homo naledi fossils discovered in the Dinaledi chamber of the Rising Star cave system, in the Cradle of Humankind, in Gauteng, as being between 335 000 and 236 000 years old, University of the Witwatersrand paleoanthropologist Professor Lee Berger said. The significance of the age of these Homo naledi fossils, which are a so-called &ldquo;deep-time&rdquo; species of hominins &ndash; meaning they share many morphological traits with early hominin species including teeth, such as large molars, and femur structure similar to the Homo habilis and Australopithecine species &ndash; is that it can be postulated that the species survived until relatively recently in the Cradle of Humankind and provides evidence of the coexistence of hominin species in Africa. Professor John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison explained the Omo Kibish remains from Ethiopia &ndash; identified as the earliest fossil evidence of modern humans &ndash; are dated at 190 000 years old. &ldquo;[Anatomically] modern humans were here in the sub-equatorial regions of Africa at the same time as Homo naledi, meaning that our relative and distant relative species were here throughout the 2-million to 1.5-million years of our evolution. We must also rethink the diversity of other hominids that existed with each other through our evolution.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Neo fossil is one of the best represented and best dated fossils in the hominin record and we have to ask serious questions about which hominin species are responsible for the archaeological sites in this area and how the hominin populations&rsquo; interactions [played a] role in our own origins.&rdquo;
