Video-on-demand solutions specialist Discover Digital on Thursday unveiled its new rental and subscription video entertainment on-demand services platform. Digital Entertainment on Demand (DEOD) offers various Internet television (TV) channels and bouquets of content direct to viewers&rsquo; phones, tablets and laptops. The service enables Internet TV channel programming, subscription-based packages and pay-per-view. &ldquo;Viewers today want freedom of choice. They want customisable, affordable access to movies, news, sports, music and TV series wherever they are,&rdquo; explained Discover Digital MD Stephen Watson. The various packages include the news service for R49, the sports service for R99 and the R189 premium package, which comprises all news and sports channels, DEOD Sports Network (DSN) and a selection of series, music videos and movies on demand. &ldquo;We also offer short-term premium subscriptions that give viewers access just for a weekend at R49 or just a week at R69, as well as special interest channels and video-on-demand bouquets for kids and music lovers, as well as faith and inspiration-related programming,&rdquo; he added. The company also revealed a DEOD rental service that provided an option for viewers to rent a selection of the latest and classic movies on a pay-per-view basis from R18 up to R30. &ldquo;We have also added the ability for viewers to schedule the download of selected content for offline playback. Very soon consumers will also be able to download immediately or schedule the download for off-peak data periods, to take advantage of the off-peak data rates that most Internet service providers and telcos offer,&rdquo; Watson explained. Advertisers and broadcast sponsors can also partner with DEOD to activate content to engage with consumers.
