The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority has fined MTN Rwanda $8.5-million owing to its noncompliance with directives prohibiting the inclusion of MTN Rwanda in the MTN South and East Africa information technology hub, based in Uganda. MTN Rwanda is studying the notification of the fine and says it will continue to engage with the regulator on the matter. MTN Group in 2016 posted a R1.4-billion headline loss &ndash; its first annual loss in 20 years &ndash; in part as a result of a massive fine issued by the Nigerian communications regulator against MTN Nigeria for failing to disconnect unregistered SIM cards. MTN Nigeria in June last year agreed to a $1.67-billion settlement with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). This follows after the NCC in October 2015 fined MTN $5.2-billion. In addition to the settlement, MTN had agreed to take steps to ensure the listing of its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
