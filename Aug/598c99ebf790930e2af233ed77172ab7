South Africa&#39;s government is considering merging its three state-owned airlines into one entity, and offering a 25% stake of the holding company to a private equity partner, a cabinet minister said on Wednesday. The loss-making South African Airways, its low-cost arm Mango and SAA Express, which services smaller towns, are struggling to remain profitable amid increased competition and rising operational costs. &quot;I believe the answer to all of it lies in how we rationalise the three companies and how we bring in a 25% shareholder to help us with both management as well as on finances,&quot; Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown told a parliamentary committee.
