	JSE-listed Pioneer Foods plans to acquire, for an undisclosed amount, UK-based The Good Carb Food Company, the owner of granola brand Lizi’s, to add to its breakfast cereals portfolio. 
	Pioneer Foods UK has been manufacturing Lizi’s products under contract for The Good Carb Food Company. 
	The group had been instrumental in codeveloping products and had gained significant product and market knowledge. 
	“This purchase is in line with our strategic plans for acquisitions in geographies and categories where we have an existing presence,” said Pioneer Foods CEO Tertius Carstens.
