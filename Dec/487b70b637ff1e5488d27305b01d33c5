South African manufacturing production growth climbed back into positive growth territory in November, rising 1.9% year-on-year, after contracting 2.7% year-on-year in October. This, BNP Paribas Securities economist Jeffrey Schultz said, also came in higher than the firm&rsquo;s consensus of a 1.1% growth forecast. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, manufacturing production climbed 0.3% in November, mainly on the back of a 2.4% increase in basic iron and steel and nonferrous metals, a 5.7% rise in motor vehicles, parts and accessories and a 0.7% climb in wood, paper, publishing and printing production. The largest negative contribution came from a 2.1% fall in petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastics production. In year-on-year terms, the improvement in headline growth was driven mainly by a return to positive production growth in food and beverages, which climbed 2.3% after contracting 6.6% the previous month. Growth in petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastics also improved to 0.4% year-on-year from -1.8% in October, alongside a stronger 6.1% bounce in basic iron and steel and nonferrous metals. The largest negative contribution came from motor vehicles, parts and accessories production, which slipped 3.2%, albeit at a slower pace of contraction following October&rsquo;s double-digit fall. &ldquo;Though on the face of things the improvement in headline manufacturing production growth looks encouraging, momentum growth in the sector shows that activity remains extremely weak,&rdquo; Schultz said. He added that the Bureau for Economic Research&#39;s newly released manufacturing purchasing managers&rsquo; index for December 2016 showed another deterioration in manufacturing activity in the final month of the year, down to 46.7 from 48.3. &ldquo;This does not bode particularly well for manufacturing&rsquo;s ability to contribute positively to fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth,&rdquo; Schultz noted.
