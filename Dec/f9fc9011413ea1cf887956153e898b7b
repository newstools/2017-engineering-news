	The Ford Struandale engine plant, in Port Elizabeth, is celebrating the assembly of 500 000 Duratorq TDCi turbodiesel engines since 2011, bringing the total of engines produced at the plant to 3.3-million units since its establishment in 1964. 
	Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa (FMCSA) is now preparing to accelerate its expanded production plan in line with its R3-billion investment in its local operations. 
	"Reaching 500 000 Duratorq TDCi engines, and a cumulative 3.3-million engines since 1964, is a fantastic achievement for the Struandale engine plant, which competes with some of the best Ford plants in the world," Ford Middle East and Africa VP operations Ockert Berry said in a statement. 
	The fully assembled 2.2-litre four-cylinder and 3.2-litre five-cylinder Duratorq TDCi engines are supplied to Ford’s Silverton assembly plant for installation in the locally-built Ford Ranger pick-up and the seven-seater Ford Everest sports-utility vehicle. 
	“Owing to its unprecedented global success, demand continues to grow, both locally and internationally for the Ford Ranger,” Berry said, highlighting FMCSA’s multibillion-rand product and capacity investment to accommodate the increasing market volumes for the Ranger in South Africa and export markets. 
	“The Struandale engine plant already achieved its highest-ever volumes for component machining and engine assembly during 2017, and we expect to set new records again in 2018,” he added. 
	Further, from 2019, South Africa is set to be the first assembly home of Ford’s new performance model, the Ranger Raptor.
