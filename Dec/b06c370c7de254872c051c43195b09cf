	Civil rights body the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has welcomed Wednesday’s judgment in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria which found that President Jacob Zuma must fulfil the remedial actions of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s 2016 State of Capture report. 
	The court found the president must institute a commission of inquiry into State capture within 30 days of the ruling. The inquiry is to be headed by a judge appointed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. 
	Zuma was also found to be personally liable for the cost of his legal challenge, as well as his aborted application to halt the report from being released. 
	Outa said on Wednesday after the judgment that it appears the judiciary has, at long last, called a halt to the president “using public funds to fight his personal battles”. 
	“Neither the courts nor public funds are meant to be abused. Taxpayers’ money should be used to provide services to the South African public and not to enrich the Zuma power elite,” Outa chief operating officer Ben Theron said in a statement. 
	‘He lost on all fronts’ 
	Outa added the president has "lost on all fronts". 
	"These judgments are about the president’s attempt to frustrate criminal investigations against him over State capture and corruption. They are about ensuring that the president is equal before the law and removing the powers he is abusing to manipulate the legal processes against him,” said Theron. 
	“South Africans long for this president to be held accountable for his conduct and those who have looted the state with him will face justice soon.”
