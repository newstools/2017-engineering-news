	The Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2010-30 was promulgated in March 2011. It was indicated at the time that the IRP should be a "living plan" which would be revised by the Department of Energy (DoE) every two years. 
	The IRP is the over-arching energy plan for the country of which the IRP forms an integral part. The publication of the IEP in November 2016 provides the framework for the interaction between different energy carriers and informs the technology potential for the IRP as well as potential energy sources and the costs associated with both. 
	The IRP 2010 identified the preferred generation technology (and assumed energy efficiency demand side management) required to meet expected demand growth up to 2030. The policy-adjusted IRP incorporated a number of government objectives, including affordable electricity, carbon mitigation, reduced water consumption, localisation and regional development, producing a balanced strategy toward diversified electricity generation sources and gradual decarbonisation of the electricity sector in South Africa.Â
