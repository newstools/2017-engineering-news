	Thursday was the last day that shares of international information and communications technology company Datatec could be traded on London’s Aim, as the company’s cancellation of its listing will take effect on Friday. 
	Datatec initially announced its intention to de-list from the London Stock Exchange on October 24, but stressed that its primary listing on the JSE would continue and remained unaffected by the Aim listing cancellation.
