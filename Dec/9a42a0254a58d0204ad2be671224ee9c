	The Presidency said on Friday that it noted the judgment by the High Court which ruled that National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams who heads the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must vacate his office. 
	The judgment was handed down in the application seeking an order declaring Abraham’s predecessor Mxolisi Nxasana's removal invalid. It was brought by nongovernmental organisations Freedom under Law, Corruption Watch and the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution against President Jacob Zuma. 
	Judge Dunstan Mlambo also ruled that it would not be just for Nxasana to be reinstated and, in the other major aspect of the judgement, that due to his pending corruption case, Zuma was now - when he had not been at the time of appointing Abrahams - conflicted in appointing an NDPP. 
	Mlambo thus gave Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa two months to appoint a new head of the NPA. 
	While Zuma awaits a full briefing on the judgement, he has been advised that an early assessment displays various grounds on which a successful appeal may be prosecuted. 
	The Presidency said the NPA was an important institution in the country’s constitutional democracy, appointments to which are not made lightly. 
	“Out of deference to the court and the judicial system, these grounds will be properly ventilated in the normal course in court proceedings,” concluded the Presidency.
