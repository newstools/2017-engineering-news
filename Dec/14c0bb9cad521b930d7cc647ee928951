	South Africa has been re-elected to serve on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) council for 2018/19 – maintaining its unbroken service record since 1999, the transport department said on Sunday. 
	Voting to elect new member States to the IMO council took place during the 30th regular session of the IMO assembly in London in the United Kingdom on Friday, the department said in a statement. 
	Deputy Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga, on behalf of the South Africa government, thanked all member States who cast their ballot in favour of South Africa. She also thanked the African Union (AU) for endorsing South Africa’s candidature in the election.
	
	The department, working in a co-ordinated manner and partnership with the international relations and co-operation department and supported by the South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa), the Ports Regulator of South Africa, and Transnet worked tirelessly to drive South Africa’s re-election campaign. 
	South Africa had a long-standing relationship with the IMO since 1948 under her observer status and became a member in 1995. The country had continued to actively maintain her relationship with the organisation and its members beyond this period. 
	“Due to her continued diligence in IMO affairs and her role in the sub-Saharan region, South Africa continued to be re-elected to the IMO council since 1999. As a member of the IMO council, South Africa served as vice chairperson from 2005 to 2015,” the department said. 
	The council which is the executive organ of the IMO is responsible for supervising the work of the organisation. The IMO itself is the global standard-setting authority for maritime safety, security, and environmental performance of international shipping.
