	Vopak Terminal Durban has awarded NYSE-listed Fluor Corporation an engineering, procurement and construction management contract to deliver the Vopak Growth 4 Project, in Durban. 
	The project forms part of Vopak’s expansion programme to increase the capacity of fuel storage at its Durban terminal to meet Southern Africa’s rising demand for fuel with cleaner specifications. 
	“This is one of Vopak’s largest storage facility projects in South Africa and the largest storage project undertaken by Fluor in Africa,” says Fluor Europe, Africa and the Middle East energy and chemicals business president Al Collins. 
	Local contractors and vendors will be used to further develop and sustain the local labour market, enterprises and economy, with Fluor using its global networks to competitively source material and equipment that cannot be obtained locally. 
	Fluor plans to use its ‘Zero Base Execution’ approach to safely develop fit-for-purpose integrated solutions to optimise the expansion of the facility. 
	“Fluor is successfully using Zero Base Execution all over the world to reduce the cost of facilities while improving schedule certainty by aligning the design and execution principles, project drivers and economic needs before design work begins,” says Fluor sub-Saharan Africa GM Alejandro Escalona. 
	Fluor previously completed Vopak’s Fuel 2 project at the same location.
