	Civil rights watchdog AfriForum says that the African National Congress’s decision to amend South Africa’s Constitution to allow expropriation without compensation boils down to a decision to commit theft and to place the country on the same road of destruction that Zimbabwe followed in its violation of property rights. 
	AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel said that respect of property is the cornerstone of a successful economy. “Countries that violate property rights are characterised by unemployment, poverty and economical decline. The ANC’s decision to violate property rights will therefore be to the detriment of everyone in the country, except the small group of elites who will benefit from the ANC’s plan,” Kriel noted. 
	He added that the ANC’s plan to violate property rights is a further indication that the ANC did not view the agreements reached during the discussions of 1994 as binding. “Minorities and others who will suffer from the ANC’s violation of the 1994 agreements can therefore not place their hopes on any ANC leader and will have to take steps themselves to look after their own interests and properties,” he pointed out. 
	The ANC’s plan to steal will not only destroy the economy of South Africa, but will also put the country on a road of renewed friction and conflict. "AfriForum, its members and others who have worked hard for what they have will not sit back and watch while their properties are being stolen,” Kriel added.
