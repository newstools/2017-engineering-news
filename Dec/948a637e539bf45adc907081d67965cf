	In response to an increasing global call to recycle a growing number of materials, an investment of R46-million has been made by paper and plastics packaging company Mpact into a new recycling facility. Dylan Slater tells us more. 
	Dylan Slater:
	The Springs-based recycling facility of Mpact has commissioned a new recycling plant able to process liquid packaging, the bulk of which is cartons. Prior to the commissioning of this plant, only one other plant nearby had the capacity to handle such material. This other plant still operates, but is smaller and uses different technology. 
	Mpact Recycling MD John Hunt explains why Mpact decided to commission the plant.

	Dylan Slater:
	The liquid packaging recycling plant uses a simple method that comprises hydro pulping, in which a small volume of water is added to a larger volume of packaging material. An agitator then causes friction, which separates the different layers of material. John explains in further detail…

	Dylan Slater:
	At the end of the process, two separate materials emerge, which are paper pulp and plastic sleeves which are embedded with a small volume of aluminum foil. John Hunt runs us through the uses of these materials.

	Dylan Slater:
	Obviously Mpact needs to source liquids cartons from somewhere. Currently a large volume is sourced from the carton and packaging manufacturers as discarded material. The remaining volumes are sourced from people and company’s which sort and divert material from landfill and at source of disposal. another stream comes from direct disposal into dedicated recycling streams, such as demarcated plastics and paper bins.
