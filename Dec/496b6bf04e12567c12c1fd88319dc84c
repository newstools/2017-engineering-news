	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has extended a $350-million loan to Ukraine's largest steel mill, owned by ArcelorMittal, for modernisation and environmental upgrades. 
	The EBRD said the loan would help finance investment worth $1.1-billion at the mill, which ArcelorMittal acquired in 2015. 
	"It is the largest private sector investment programme in Ukraine in recent years," the bank said.Â
