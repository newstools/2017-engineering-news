	The Gauteng dams which form part of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) continue to climb up to higher levels following a period of consistent decline.
	
	The IVRS is this week in sharp contrast compared to what it was last year during the same time. The system is currently at 71.9% compared to last year’s 53.7%. Last week, the system was at 71.2%, recording an increase of 0.7% this week.
	
	The IVRS consists of 14 dams which supply the Gauteng which is poised to experience inflows of people during the Festive Season. The system is the mainstay supply of water to Sasol and Eskom.
	
	The Vaal dam, on the border of Gauteng and the Free State, has notched an increase from 79.4% last week to 80.5% this week. Last year, the dam hovered at 40%, a situation which required the implementation of water restrictions in Gauteng.
	
	The gloomy picture at the Katse dam, in Lesotho, continued to persist this week, although the dam is slightly up from last week levels and now sitting at 34% from 33.4% last week. At the same time last year, the dam was at a concerning 37.8%.
	
	The Grootdraai dam, near Standerton, in Mpumalanga, has recorded an increase by 10.1% this week, now standing at 91.8% Last year, it stood at 89.6%
	
	Remaining unchanged from last week, the Bloemhof dam, in the Free State, sits comfortably at 81.5% this week, up from last year’s waterless 20.2%.
	
	Similarly remaining unchanged this week but sitting an impressive level, the Sterkfontein dam is hovering at 94.2%, up from last year’s 86.1%.
	
	Despite the recent changes for the better in our weather conditions, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) regards the recent downpours as a relief after Gauteng dams consistently went down week-on-week. 
	
	With the prospect of consumers increasing in the province during this period of festivities, the DWS called on the public to use every opportunity to conserve water and reminded them that the country is still very much feeling the impact of drought.
