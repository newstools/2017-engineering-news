Cape Town-based waste-to-protein producer AgriProtein says it has secured $17.5-million of further capital from its key strategic partners to fund the company&rsquo;s expansion into Europe, North America and Asia. &nbsp; The new investment values the fly-farming venture at more than $117-million. &nbsp; The new round of funding enables AgriProtein to meet what it says is &ldquo;growing demand from animal feed suppliers for a natural and cost-effective alternative to fishmeal, widely used in the poultry and fish farming industries&rdquo;. &ldquo;Our fly larvae product is already enjoyed by our consumers &ndash; the millions of happy chickens and fish around the world &ndash; for whom it&rsquo;s a natural source of protein,&rdquo; says co-founder Jason Drew. &ldquo;The new funding demonstrates a growing appetite for fly-farming in the global investment community, helping us pursue our mission to find a better way to feed the world.&rdquo; &nbsp; On the world&rsquo;s largest farm by headcount &ndash; located&nbsp;in Cape Town &ndash; AgriProtein produces and licenses MagMeal, a high-protein feed made from dried, milled and de-fatted larvae produced by Black Soldier flies (Hermetia illucens), fed on existing organic waste derived from municipal and other industrial waste partners. &nbsp; Using its army of 8.5-billion flies, AgriProtein&rsquo;s facility recycles 250 t of waste a day, with larvae production of up to 50 t a day. Its product replaces fishmeal in agriculture and aquaculture feeds. AgriProtein considers the trawling of fish for fishmeal as &ldquo;one of the most destructive activities on the planet&rdquo;. JHB FLY FARM Drew tells Engineering News Online that AgriProtein has &ldquo;progressed well&rdquo; with its plans to establish a fly farm in Johannesburg. A trial site has already been established in Durban. The company has also allocated a number of international licences for use of its technology in Australia, Asia, Europe, the US and China.&nbsp; &ldquo;MagMeal is in great demand. We have also been exporting &ndash; very short term &ndash; to our licensees to help them establish markets before they build their own sites,&rdquo; notes Drew. &ldquo;We are building licensing support centres in North America, the European Union and Asia to support our licensees. &ldquo;We are also building our own wants in certain strategic locations to underpin our licensees.&rdquo; MORE THAN MAGMEAL Apart from MagMeal, AgriProtein also uses its fly farms to produce MagOil, which is a &ldquo;natural, omega-rich oil for use in feeds&rdquo; and MagSoil, &ldquo;a high-quality compost for use in farming and horticulture&rdquo;. AgriProtein was founded in 2008.&nbsp; MagMeal was developed, trialled and proved in the lab between 2008 and 2010, leaving AgriProtein to demonstrate it could manufacture at volume.&nbsp; The break-through came in 2011, with output at its demonstration plant achieving 100 kg a day.&nbsp; With price per ton a key determinant in the fight against fishmeal, the next challenge was to further increase scale while reducing costs to make the product commercially competitive.&nbsp; This was achieved in 2015 in AgriProtein&rsquo;s first 9000 m2 factory in Cape Town. However, the company is &ldquo;actively seeking further investment&rdquo; to take it to its next stage of growth. &nbsp; AgriProtein&rsquo;s research partners include the University of Stellenbosch; Rhodes University; the University of Swaziland; the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and the University of Alicante, Spain. Its strategic partners are the Cristof Group, Austria (Engineering) and the Twynam Group, Australia (agriculture). &nbsp;
