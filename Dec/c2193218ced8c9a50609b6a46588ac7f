	The Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) on Monday reported that the Automotive Industry Development Centre (AIDC), in partnership with Nissan South Africa, has successfully met the training criteria to become an IMI-approved international centre in South Africa. 
	After successfully completing a three-day assessment, the AIDC’s two automotive learning centres in Rosslyn are now able to grant IMI international qualifications to its learners. The IMI’s Quality Assessment process enables the AIDC students to study and gain new skills in the automotive industry. 
	The IMI’s approval of the AIDC/Nissan partnership is also an independent assurance of professional standards and training quality, which sets a benchmark for professionalism in the automotive industry. 
	“Like the AIDC, we at Nissan also believe that the basic principles for success are transparency, diversity, learning, and constantly challenging people to produce their best work.   While the future of South Africa isn’t in any doubt, Nissan’s partnership with the AIDC will assist in addressing some of the challenges currently being experienced with skills development in the industry, allowing for opportunities to grow,” says Nissan South Africa human resources director Nabiel Conybeare. 
	AIDC CEO Dr David Masondo added that he was delighted that the Gauteng automotive learning centre had been accredited by the UK-based IMI. “This does not only validate our skills programme but raises us to globally competitive standards.  It gives us an opportunity to be part of the international automotive industry community.” 
	Both organisations are committed to the further development of automotive training and education to upskill individuals who are key to the business’ success and personal prosperity.
