	The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) lifted the suspension of train drivers and metro guards of the United National Transport Union (UNTU) who refused to work under unsafe working conditions with immediate effect and agreed that no disciplinary steps will be taken against them. 
	Prasa’s newly appointed acting CEO Cromet Molepo also engaged UNTU in a discussion on the way forward to stabilise the passenger rail service in the Western Cape. These discussions would continue December 21, in Johannesburg. 
	UNTU general secretary Steve Harris says in the light of the turn of events and Prasa’s co-operation with UNTU’s demand, the union would not go ahead with a strike at the passenger rail agency yet. 
	UNTU declared a dispute on Friday after Prasa suspended several train drivers and metro guards who refused to work on the notoriously dangerous Central Line between Khayelitsha and Cape Town yesterday, but availed themselves for service on other routes. 
	UNTU demanded that Prasa adhere to safety regulations. The union must give Prasa 48 hours’ notice of its intention to embark on a protected strike. 
	Harris said the union would keep members abreast of the latest developments on Thursday.
