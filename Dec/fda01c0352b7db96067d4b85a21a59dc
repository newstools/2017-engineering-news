	The High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday ruled that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will select the judge to preside over the State capture commission of inquiry ordered by former public protector Thuli Madonsela. 
	"The President [Jacob Zuma] is directed to appoint a commission of inquiry within 30 days, headed by a judge solely selected by the Chief Justice [Mogoeng]," said Judge President Dunstan Mlambo when he delivered the judgement on behalf of a full bench. 
	"The President shall take steps which are necessary to give effect to the remedial action [prescribed by Madonsela] and ensure that the judge who heads the commission of inquiry is given powers to appoint his/her own staff, and to investigate all the issues using the record of the public protector's investigation and the State Capture report."Â
