	A new 650 000 bbl/d refinery being built by Africa's richest man in Nigeria is expected to come on stream by the end of 2019, Nigeria's Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said on Tuesday. 
	Kachikwu said Africa's biggest economy was also close to finalising the process to get private partners to revamp three existing refineries, which would add a cumulative total of 450 000 bbl/d as Nigeria looks to reduce its dependence on imported refined products.Â
