	The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has published the dates and venues for its upcoming public hearings into Eskom’s revenue application for the 2018/19 financial year. 
	Eskom has applied for an allowable revenue of R219.5-billion, which would translate to a 19.9% average increase in electricity tariffs from April 1, 2018. 
	The hearings will take place in all nine provinces between Monday, October 30 and Thursday, November 16 – see attached schedule. They are scheduled to take place for 9:00 to 17:00 on all nine of the days set aside by the regulator. 
	Nersa has requested those members of the public and stakeholders who wish to make oral representations to register by 15:30 on Monday, October 23. Applicants should specify the hearing at which they wish to present. 
	“The dates of the public hearings might be extended depending on the number of presenters who register,” Nersa said, adding that it could also cancel a scheduled hearing should it fail to receive any requests to make presentations.
