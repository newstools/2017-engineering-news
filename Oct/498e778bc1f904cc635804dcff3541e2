	Tullow Oil said on Thursday it had bought 90% stakes in four onshore blocks in Côte d'Ivoire while state oil company Petroci holds the remaining 10%. 
	The four blocks cover 5 035 km2 and are located on the coast, mostly to the west of Abidjan. 
	Tullow, which currently holds a nonoperated position in the Espoir offshore field in Côte d'Ivoire, said it intends to initiate work immediately on the four new licences to allow surveying to start in early 2018.
