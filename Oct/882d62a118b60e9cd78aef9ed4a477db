	Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has warned construction companies to comply with South Africa’s labour laws or face being shut down. 
	Oliphant’s warning came after she visited a construction site where 400 housing units were being built in Rustenburg, North West. 
	She said she was concerned about reports she received that some companies were flouting construction regulations at the site. 
	”If construction companies do not comply we will have no choice but to issue prohibition notices to stop them from continuing with their work. We will not compromise workers’ safety and lives,” said Oliphant. 
	The project is a R2.2-billion Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) investment project by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC).
	
	Oliphant said she awaited a report about the state of compliance by construction companies that are part of the project.
