JSE-listed diversified industrial group Kap Industrial has concluded its R4.1-billion acquisition of Sasolburg-based polypropylene and high-density polyethylene manufacturer Safripol. The transaction, effective January 1, was funded through a combination of debt and equity, including R1.5-billion in new equity through a clawback offer, nearly R1.4-billion through private and public three- and five-year bonds and R1.2-billion through three-year term debt and revolving credit facilities. The deal would increase Kap&rsquo;s yearly revenue by more than 20%, Kap CEO Gary Chaplin said in an update to shareholders on Tuesday. &ldquo;It is our largest acquisition to date and supports our ambition to grow through investment in industry-leading industrial assets complementary to our existing operations,&rdquo; he added, citing the new addition&rsquo;s &ldquo;good strategic fit&rdquo; with Kap&rsquo;s Hosaf business. Kap plans to publish its interim financial results on February 13.
