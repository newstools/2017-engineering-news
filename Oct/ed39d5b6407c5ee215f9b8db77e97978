Cape Town International Airport (CTIA) is, in collaboration with the Western Cape government, targeting the development and initiation of new routes to key strategic markets. Cape Town Air Access, in a partnership with CTIA, the City of Cape Town, Wesgro, Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) and Cape Town Tourism, have secured six new routes and eight route expansions, resulting in over half-a-million more two-way seats coming into Cape Town. Since July last year, this additional capacity has generated roughly R3-billion in additional tourism revenue for the Western Cape. In December, CTIA also achieved the milestone of ten-million passengers a year for the first time. Western Cape Economic Opportunities Minister Alan Winde, commended CTIA on this achievement, which was reached on December 28. &ldquo;The CTIA has hit its biggest milestone yet, highlighting once again that it is a major asset not only for those who pass through it, but for jobs and growth in our economy. &ldquo;At a time when tourism to our region is at an all-time high, this team is continuing to up its game, offering world class service to passengers visiting our region,&rdquo; he stated. Further, Winde pointed out that through partnerships with the airport, tourism to the Western Cape is on the rise. &ldquo;This is in line with our Project Khulisa growth strategy, through which we are seeking to create up to 100 000 additional tourism jobs in our region,&rdquo; he noted. CTIA GM Deon Cloete added that reaching the ten-million passengers a year mark was an important milestone for ACSA and for the Western Cape region. &ldquo;CTIA is a critical gateway for the continuing growth of domestic and international tourism to the Western Cape and we have seen solid passenger volume growth over the past few years.&rdquo; CTIA is the second-busiest airport in South Africa and third-busiest in Africa.
