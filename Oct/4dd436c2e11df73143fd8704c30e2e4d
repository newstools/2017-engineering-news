	JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Temporary power generation equipment supplier Aggreko has commissioned a 7.4 MW diesel power facility at Aim-listed Hummingbird Resources’ Yanfolila mine, in Mali. 
	The facility will provide power to the mine’s process plant. 
	“Getting reliable, efficient and cost-effective power supply is critical when it comes to mining operations.  Aggreko's technologies provide a scalable and efficient power that can accommodate any change of needs and resources available,” says Aggreko Africa MD James Shepherd. 
	Hummingbird CEO Dan Betts says the company is also continuing to evaluate potential renewable energy solutions, such as solar photovoltaic. 
	He added that the next milestones that are likely to be reached at Yanfolila are the commissioning of water supply and the testing of the fully installed mill. 
	Hummingbird expects to achieve the first gold pour at Yanfolila by December. 
	The mine is expected to produce 132 000 oz of gold in its first full year of operation.
