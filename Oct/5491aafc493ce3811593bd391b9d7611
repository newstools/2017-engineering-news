	BMW Group sales of electrified vehicles in the first three quarters of 2017 have exceeded those achieved in the whole of 2016, says the German car maker. 
	In September, group electrified vehicle sales topped the 10 000-unit mark for the first time in a single month. 
	The term ‘electrified’ refers to battery electric and hybrid vehicles. 
	With the company’s electrified line-up already totalling nine models, a total of 10 786 BMW i, BMW iPerformance and Mini electric vehicles were delivered to customers in September, bringing the year-to-date total to 68 687 units, up 64.2% compared with the same period last year. 
	“The BMW Group has the largest share of the electrified market worldwide,” says BMW sales and brand management board member Dr Ian Robertson. 
	“This year, we have already sold more electrified vehicles than in the whole of last year and we are well on track to deliver our target of 100 000 [units] by year-end.” 
	“The continued significant sales growth of these vehicles is due in part to the increasing availability of the BMW 5 Series plug-in hybrid, which in some markets accounts for up to a third of BMW 5 Series sedan sales.”
