	JSE-listed Echo Polska Properties has acquired a portfolio of 12 retail properties – of which eight are shopping centres and four are retail parks, with more than 620 stores – across Poland. 
	The portfolio has an aggregate gross lettable area (GLA) of about 450 000 m2 – doubling the GLA of Echo Polska’s current retail portfolio.

	The net operating income for the first tranche portfolio on an annualised basis amounts to €25.1-million and €23-million for the forecast 11-month period ending December 31, 2018. 
	The second tranche portfolio comprises a further six properties with a GLA of 184 000 m2 and an aggregate value of €222.5-million.
