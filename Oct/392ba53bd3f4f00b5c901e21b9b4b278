	The City of Ekurhuleni is set to kick off the first official run of its bus rapid transit (BRT) service, Harambee, next week as part of the implementation of its Phase 1A operations. 
	The limited service, starting on Wednesday, will run eight buses in mixed traffic along the 38 km service route, with 33 kerbside stops, between Tembisa and Isando. 
	The buses, with 36-seat and 54-standing room capacity, will operate between 05:00 and 19:00 on weekdays, and from 06:00 to 16:30 on Saturdays, at 20 minute peak hour intervals and hourly off-peak intervals. 
	The buses will not be available on Sundays or public holidays. 
	The full roll-out of the Harambee Phase 1A service includes the introduction of new elements into the system until it is ready to operate as a fully-fledged BRT system, as well as the construction of pedestrian bridges. 
	By February, 32 additional buses will be added to the fleet and an EMV-based ticketing solution introduced. 
	Currently, tickets are sold at two Ekurhuleni branded mobile kiosks, one at the Tembisa police station and another at the Birch Acres mall, in Isando. 
	The first section of trunk route and trunk stations will be operational in September 2018, while an additional 16 km route, incorporating the section to Tembisa Hospital, and 40 more buses will be operational in April 2019. 
	The completion of the full Phase 1A is planned for 2020.Â
