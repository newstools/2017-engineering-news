	JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Improved efficiencies and production levels at the Impala Rustenburg mine coincided with a turnaround at the Marula mine in the three months to September 30, Impala Platinum Holdings (Implats) said on Tuesday, when it expressed disappointment at five fatalities at Impala Rustenburg and one at Marula. 
	“Implats remains committed to ensuring zero harm. Management remains resolute in leading through direct engagement with all our stakeholders, including each employee in the organisation, the leadership of our representative unions and government,” the company, headed by CEO Nico Muller, said in a release to Creamer Media’s Mining Weekly Online. 
	Tonnes milled across the group rose 9.6% to 6 741 000 t on Impala Platinum’s 6.7% higher production of 349 000 oz with Zimplats and Mimosa in Zimbabwe once again steadfast. 
	But final refined metal output fell on furnace maintenance at Impala Rustenburg’s number 3 and 5 furnaces and at Zimplats’ single furnace, which resulted in a build-up of concentrate stock, causing 6.6% lower gross refined platinum output of 341 200 oz. 
	The wear of the Impala number 5 furnace was found to be so excessive that a decision was taken to elevate the maintenance effort to complete furnace refurbishing, which has resulted in a lowering of yearly guidance to between 1.51-million ounces and 1.56-million ounces as the furnace is now only scheduled to come back on line in December. 
	Zimplats kept its performance above design capacity to achieve an unchanged 71 000 oz of platinum in concentrate. However, maintenance of its furnace lowered matte output, and the metal produced during the furnace shutdown will be exported as concentrate in the three months to end December. 
	Marula increased tonnes milled 11.7% to 498 000 t and lifted platinum-in-concentrate production by 9.4% to 23 200 oz, assisted by ongoing multi-stakeholder interventions to prevent community protest action and business interruptions. 
	Mimosa’s platinum-in-concentrate production rose 5.6% to 32 200 oz on improved tonnage and higher mill grade. 
	Two Rivers’ tonnes milled fell 2.8% to 852 000 t on 10.2% lower mill grade of 3.70 g/t, which resulted in platinum-in-concentrate production falling 15.6% to 41 600 oz. 
	Impala Refining Services refined 208 700 oz of platinum, 2.7% fewer ounces than in the prior comparable quarter owing to the furnace-maintenance-related accumulation of concentrate stocks.
