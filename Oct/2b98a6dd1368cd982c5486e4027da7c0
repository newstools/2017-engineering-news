	Property developer Abland has two precincts enrolled in the Green Building Council South Africa’s (GBCSA’s) sustainable precint pilot study. 
	The properties are Sandton Gate, on William Nicol drive, in Sandton, and Loftus Park, which is adjacent to Loftus Versfeld stadium, in Pretoria.
	 
	“At Abland, we conceptualise each development with the urban fabric in mind. The idea is to contribute positively to the immediate neighbourhood rather than standing in isolation,” Abland marketing director Grant Silverman said in a statement.
	 
	In line with this initiative, the green sustainable precinct rating may eventually become the ultimate achievement for property developers, he noted. 
	“A green precinct is beneficial to the developer, tenants, the environment and communities surrounding and inhabiting it. Property values increase when located in a sought-after, aesthetically pleasing, safe, secure and clean precinct,” he said.
	 
	Currently, Abland has 13 precinct developments in the pipeline with nine currently under way. 
	These range from mixed-use precincts and industrial estates to an entire town complete with lifestyle residential offerings, regional malls, additional strip malls, small convenience retail outlets, restaurants and cafés, motor dealerships and big box opportunities, filling stations, schools, tertiary institutions and an array of private and public open spaces.
	 
	To achieve its green star rating, a precinct is rated against five categories, namely governance, liveability, economic prosperity, environment and innovation, with each category requiring a minimum score to ensure a holistic approach.
	 
	“Generally, local municipalities are eager to become involved with developers who reach out to assist them in improving their functionality. It becomes a shared responsibility that everyone benefits from,” said Silverman.
