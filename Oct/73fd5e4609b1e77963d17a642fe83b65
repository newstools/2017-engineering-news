	The Liberated Metalworkers Union of South Africa’s (Limusa) strike at Toyota Tsusho Africa in Durban, entered its fourth day on Monday. 
	Limusa, an affiliate of the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu), said that the protected industrial action was as a result of the company’s refusal to grant the union organisational rights as required by the Labour Relations Act. The strike began last week Wednesday. 
	Limusa was formally established in November 2014, following the breakaway the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) from Cosatu. The union was trying to make inroads at Numsa-dominated factories like Toyota Tsusho Africa. 
	Toyota Tsusho Africa, a subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corp, operates as an automotive trading and supply-chain company. It also provides coils, cut sheets, tubes, bars, and wires. 
	Limusa secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Mawonga Madolo, said they have engaged the company and further referred the matter to the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). 
	“The strike is proceeding indefinitely as workers are firm behind the demand of recognition to the union of their choice. The company has failed to provide any tangible reasons for their continued refusal to recognise Limusa,” Madolo said. 
	“It is clear that the company is disregarding the constitutional rights of workers to join and form trade unions of their choice. The company is also not consistent on the recognition of trade unions in the workplace as it has recognised other unions which had the same membership as Limusa in the recent past.” 
	Toyota Tsusho Africa was not immediately available for comment on Monday as no one was available to speak to the media. 
	Madolo urged the union’s members to be united behind their demands and conduct themselves in a peaceful manner.
