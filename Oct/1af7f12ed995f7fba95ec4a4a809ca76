	MTN has appointed Ebenezer Asante VP of its expanded Southern, East Africa and Ghana (Seagha) region. 
	The new Seagha region will comprise the mobile operations in Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, South Sudan, Botswana and Swaziland, as well as the MTN Internet service providers in Kenya, Namibia and Botswana.   
	“Asante’s appointment to this new role not only speaks to our strong bench strength, but [also] the pool of talent we have within MTN. He will bring great value to the group leadership team, to the benefit of our people and customers across the MTN footprint,” MTN CEO Rob Shuter said in a statement on Friday. 
	The inclusion of Ghana within the region rebalances the workload across MTN Group’s regional structures, further optimising the oversight responsibilities of the regional VPs.   
	Asante is currently the CEO of MTN Ghana, a position he has held since July 2015. 
	He was recognised as the Best CEO in the MTN group last year, and received a similar award at the 2016 AfricaCom Conference in Cape Town.
