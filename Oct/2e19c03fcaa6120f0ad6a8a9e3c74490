	JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Trade union Solidarity said on Tuesday that it had received a favourable wage offer from the Chamber of Mines, following extensive coal industry pay bargaining.
	 
	Mining Weekly Online can report that the wage offer ranges from 5.5% to 7.5% and involves a 7.5% wage increase at the Anglo Coal, Exxaro and Glencore mining houses, a 7% increase from Kangra and a 5% increase at Delmas and Msobo. 
	Solidarity mining industry deputy general secretary Connie Prinsloo said that provision had been made for an increase in housing and travelling allowances and that the union had also been successful in negotiating four months of maternity leave for female employees. 
	“A dispute would not have been to the benefit of the industry,” said Prinsloo, who is awaiting member feedback.
	 
	The three-year agreement offered is seen as being conducive to industry stability.
