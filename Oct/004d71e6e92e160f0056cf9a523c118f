	State-owned airliner South African Airways (SAA) has placed a revised wage offer on the table, with trade unions the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu), Uasa and the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (Numsa) set to make a decision on the matter this week. 
	This followed wage negotiation deadlocks between maintenance arm SAA Technical and the three unions and the subsequent notice of pending strike action served by Satawu on September 29. 
	The national airliner embarked on a review and moved to update its contingency measures to ensure business continuity to minimise the impact of any strike action on its operations. 
	“Since the notice was served, management obtained a revised mandate from the board of directors and met with the three labour unions to present a revised offer to the unions on October 4,” SAA said in a statement. 
	The offer was not immediately rejected and the unions requested time to consult with their members. 
	SAA expected feedback this week. 
	“While the company appreciates the demand for salary increases, this must be done being mindful of current financial constraints the company is facing and such demands must be tested against affordability and sustainability principles in wage negotiations,” SAA added. 
	However, the airliner assured that it remained committed to working jointly with the labour unions to find solutions that accommodate the employees’ demands, safeguard the business and to avert possible industrial action.
