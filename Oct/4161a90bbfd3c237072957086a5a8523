	The Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) on Friday said it had injected R542-million into several major infrastructure and equipment projects at the Port of East London over the past few years as part of Operation Phakisa. 
	This includes the R219-million refurbishment of the dry dock to support ship repair and marine manufacturing and the R108-million project to rehabilitate the 83 m wharf adjacent to the Princess Elizabeth Dry Dock and Latimer’s Landing. 
	With multiple functions, including use as a ship repair facility and for berthing small craft, the wharf, completed earlier this month, will support the port’s Operation Phakisa ambitions of focusing on marine transport and manufacturing. 
	“Construction contractor Haw & Inglis sourced labour and material locally, in line with Transnet’s supplier development requirements, while preliminary investigations, engineering design and site supervision were undertaken by the East London Aurecon office,” said TNPA acting port manager Alvin Singama, adding that the port was gearing up to further enhance its capacity with an expansion of its automotive facilities and the upgrade of maritime engineering offerings. 
	The total dry dock refurbishment project is expected to be completed in 2021, with new switchgear and crane rails already completed. 
	Other investments already completed at the port earlier this year include the R176-million West Bank Foreshore protection project, with the upgrade of the port’s tanker berth fire protection system under way. 
	TNPA said the port was also replacing its rail network and refurbishing the Buffalo bridge, while port security received an investment of R92-million to date, with further investments on surveillance equipment under way. 
	“Deepening and widening of the port’s entrance channel is still in prefeasibility stage, with TNPA exploring various designs and layouts based on modelling and completed simulations of vessel manoeuvring,” said Singama. 
	Feasibility studies for the Latimer’s Landing jetty project have been completed and are awaiting finalisation of approval by the Eastern Cape Heritage Resource Agency.
