	National airliner South African Airways (SAA) and trade unions Uasa and the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa have signed the revised wage agreement for workers at maintenance arm SAA Technical (SAAT). 
	The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu), which had also signed the agreement and had formally withdrawn its strike notice, is expected to meet with management of the airliner on Friday afternoon. 
	“This means that the threat to cause possible operational instability as a result of industrial action has effectively been removed,” said SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali in a statement on Friday. 
	This had followed wage negotiation deadlocks between SAAT and the three unions and the subsequent notice of pending strike action served by Satawu on September 29, which prompted SAA to table a revised wage offer on Wednesday.
