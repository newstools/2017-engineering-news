	JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Platinum miner Northam is supporting a campaign by US-based Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA) to raise awareness of clean energy technology. 
	Globally, governments are being urged to support investment in technology to provide cleaner and more efficient sources of power in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors, Northam CEO Paul Dunne said in a statement on Monday. 
	This is particularly relevant in light of climate change and developments at the World Economic Forum and with the Paris agreement on climate change at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
	“Now that fuel cell electric vehicles have moved firmly into the commercial phase, government policy is required to serve as a guideline for a national development and implementation plan,” he added, referencing the developments in the automobile sector. 
	In addition, the traditional internal combustion engines which are fitted with platinum group metals- (PGMs-) bearing emission-reducing catalysts will continue to ensure that increasingly stringent emissions standards can be met. 
	With the application of PGMs in emerging and existing technologies delivering a beneficial impact on the environment, Northam “added its voice” to FCHEA, which, in conjunction with other industry bodies and federal governments on October 8 celebrated the third National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day with various activities throughout the US. 
	“As a reliable and growing producer of these precious metals, we at Northam are committed to continue to supply PGMs into a market which seeks to enhance the quality of the global environment,” Dunne concluded.
