	The South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) will host its Project and Construction Management Professions conference on October 18 and 19 at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg. 
	Following four successful conferences, this year’s event takes up last year’s outstanding issues and raises new "burning issues" in the project and construction management sector. 
	“It is important to tackle outstanding issues from last year, as these still affect the project and construction management sector, hence it will be a grave mistake to let them slip,” SACPMP communications manager Yuven Gounden says.
	
	The conference's objective is to promote growth, development and transformation in the project and construction management professions. 
	“Transforming is a force that can unite a shared vision in order to contribute more significantly to a stronger South African project and construction management industry,” adds Gounden.
