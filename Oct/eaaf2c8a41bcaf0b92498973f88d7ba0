	The European Union (EU) has decided to set duties on hot-rolled steel from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Ukraine after a complaint by EU manufacturers that the product used for construction and machinery was being sold at excessively low prices. 
	The EU will levy antidumping tariffs of between €17.60/t and €96.50/t from Saturday, the EU's official journal said on Friday. 
	The European Commission had initially proposed setting a minimum price of €472.27/t, but revised its proposal after failing to secure backing from EU member States.
