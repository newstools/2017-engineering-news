	Willington Ngwepe has been appointed CEO of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), after having served as acting CEO from July 7. 
	This follows after the suspension of former CEO Pakamile Pongwana, in July. Icasa and Pongwana in August agreed to a “mutual separation”. 
	Ngwepe joined Icasa as COO in September 2014. 
	Icasa’s council states that Ngwepe’s experience, knowledge of the authority and his demonstrable leadership capabilities and stakeholder-centric approach, have equipped him to provide the leadership needed to successfully execute the authority’s mandate. 
	“The council is excited about the appointment of Mr Ngwepe and we have full confidence in his leadership and management skills. He is indeed the ideal incumbent to usher Icasa into the new phase as we tackle some of the burning issues such as the high cost of data, spectrum-related projects and so on,” comments Icasa acting chairperson Paris Mashile.
