	Telecommunications giant MTN this week filed a Statement of Defence plea as its protracted legal battle with Turkish mobile operator Turkcell rages on over a 2004 telecommunications operating licence bid in Iran. 
	The Turkish rival has brought several international and local claims against MTN for allegedly causing the Turkish operator to lose the licence bid, through an overturned decision, by using alleged acts of bribery and corruption. 
	Turkcell has finally brought the battle to South Africa’s courts, marking the fifth litigation attempt to hold MTN legally accountable. 
	Turkcell is seeking $4.2-billion in damages after MTN acquired a 49% interest in Irancell Communication Services, the company that was awarded the second GSM licence in Iran, in November 2005. 
	“MTN remains of the view that Turkcell's claim is opportunistic, an abuse of the process of court, baseless and without merit – we will not be bullied, harassed and oppressed in this matter and have every expectation that we will prevail,” MTN said in a statement on Tuesday.
