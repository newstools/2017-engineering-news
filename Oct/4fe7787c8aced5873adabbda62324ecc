	The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Friday dismissed with costs the appeal by President Jacob Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the spy tapes saga. 
	SCA Justice Eric Leach upheld the High Court’s view that the decision to withdraw 783 charges of corruption and fraud against Zuma was irrational. 
	Justice Leach, who only took eight minutes to hand down his ruling, said that the manner in which the case was conducted on behalf of the NPA was inexcusable. 
	It’s now probably clear that the NPA should immediately reinstate charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering and corruption against Zuma. 
	Zuma and the NPA asked for leave to appeal a judgment of the Gauteng North High Court last year, which ruled in favour of the Democratic Alliance (DA), setting aside the 2009 decision by the NPA’s former Director of Public Prosecution Mokotedi Mpshe to discontinue the corruption case against Zuma, on the basis of irrationality. 
	Justice Leach also ruled that the NPA and Zuma must pay the costs of DA counsels.
