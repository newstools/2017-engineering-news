	Mobile operator MTN’s financial performance in the quarter ended September 30 has been negatively impacted on by exchange rate movements. 
	The JSE-listed firm on Tuesday posted a 13.4% decline in total revenue and 14% decrease in group service revenue for the three months. 
	On a constant currency basis, MTN’s total revenue increased by 6.9%, with group service revenue up 7.4%, explained MTN president and CEO Rob Shuter. 
	Data revenue increased by 31.4% and digital revenue was up by 19.6% during the quarter under review. 
	The group’s South African operation achieved a 5.2% increase in organic service revenue, while Nigeria reported an 11.2% increase in total revenue supported by data revenue growth of 72.1%. 
	However, owing to the continued refinement of the active subscriber definitions and lower reported subscribers in Nigeria, exacerbated by the disconnection of 750 000 subscribers in Uganda as a result of regulatory Sim registration requirements, group subscribers edged down a marginal 0.7% quarter-on-quarter to 230.2-million. 
	During the September quarter, MTN deployed 1 641 third-generation and 2 102 fourth-generation sites.
